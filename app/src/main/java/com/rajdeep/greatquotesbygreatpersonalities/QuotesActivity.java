It is interesting how gradually our life changes us in the very subtleties of our soul, so that even the closest of family ties dwindle into habitual friendship. Deep inside we no longer understand one another, and are incapable of actively empathizing with the other, or knowing what emotions move the other.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“On his cheerful father: He was content to observe without wishing for more.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“For a place to be born in, the house is pleasant enough, because on that occasion one makes no great aesthetic demands; instead one begins life screaming at one\'s dear ones, without bothering too much about reasons and circumstances.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“Live with purpose. Don\'t let people or things around you get you down.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“Death is a reality… Life ends definitely when the subject, by his actions, no longer affects his environment… He can no longer add an iota to the sum total of his experience.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“Sometimes the only thought that sustains me and is my only refuge from despair is that I have always done everything I could within my small power, and that year in, year out, I have never permitted myself any amusements or diversions except those afforded by my studies.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“I want to go when I want.

To keep your balance, you must keep moving.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“A table, a chair, a bowl of fruit and a violin; what else does a man need to be happy?”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“On how he sees himself: A person with no roots anywhere…a stranger everywhere.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“I am a real lone wolf who has never wholeheartedly belonged to the State, to my country, my circle of friends and not even to my family but who, despite all these bonds, has constantly experienced a feeling of strangeness and the need for solitude.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“Be a loner. That gives you time to wonder, to search for the truth. Have holy curiosity. Make your life worth living.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“Although I have a regular work schedule, I take time to go for long walks on the beach so that I can listen to what is going on inside my head. If my work isn\'t going well, I lie down in the middle of a workday and gaze at the ceiling while I listen and visualize what goes on in my imagination.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“I am neither a German citizen, nor do I believe in anything that can be described as a ‘Jewish faith.\' But I am a Jew and glad to belong to the Jewish people, though I do not regard it in any way as chosen.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“My passionate interest in social justice and social responsibility has always stood in curious contrast to a marked lack of desire for direct association with men and women.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“I am a horse for single harness, not cut out for tandem or team work. I have never belonged wholeheartedly to country or state, to my circle of friends, or even to my own family. These ties have always been accompanied by a vague aloofness, and the wish to withdraw into myself increases with the years.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“When I was young, all I wanted and expected from life was to sit quietly in some corner doing my work without the public paying attention to me.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“It is strange to be known so universally and yet to be so lonely.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“Solitude can be tolerated only up to a certain limit, you know.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“There are two means of refuge from the misery of life - music and cats.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“I lived in solitude in the country and noticed how the monotony of a quiet life stimulates the creative mind.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“The woman who follows the crowd will usually go no further than the crowd. The woman who walks alone is likely to find herself in places no one has ever been before.\nI believe in one thing, that only a life lived for others is a life worth living.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“With fame I become more and more stupid, which of course is a very common phenomenon.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“Why is it that nobody understands me, yet everybody likes me?”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“Without deep reflection one knows from daily life that one exists for other people.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“I simply enjoy giving more than receiving in every respect, to not take myself nor the doings of the masses seriously, am not ashamed of my weaknesses and vices, and naturally take things as they come with equanimity and humor. Many people are like this, and I really cannot understand why I have been made into a kind of idol.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“There is far too great a disproportion between what one is and what others think one is, or at least what they say they think one is. But one has to take it all with good humor.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“Of course, understanding of our fellow-beings is important. But this understanding becomes fruitful only when it is sustained by sympathetic feeling in joy and in sorrow. The cultivation of this most important spring of moral action is that which is left of religion when it has been purified of the elements of superstition.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“Desire for approval and recognition is a healthy motive, but the desire to be acknowledged as better, stronger or more intelligent than a fellow being or fellow scholar easily leads to an excessively egoistic psychological adjustment.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“Many times a day I realize how much my outer and inner life is based upon the labors of my fellow men, both living and dead, and how much I must exert myself in order to give in return as much as I have received.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“It is an irony of fate that I myself have been the recipient of excessive admiration and reverence from my fellow-beings, through no fault or merit of my own.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“The best way to cheer yourself is to cheer somebody else up.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“The high destiny of the individual is to serve rather than to rule.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“The only way to escape the corruptible effect of praise is to go on working.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“I speak to everyone in the same way, whether he is the garbage man or the president of the university.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“Look around at how people want to get more out of life than they put in. A man of value will give more than he receives.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“I am content in my later years.

For us, it\'s always the next dream.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“If you are working on something exciting that you really care about, you don\'t have to be pushed. The vision pulls you.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“When we create stuff, we do it because we listen to customers, get their inputs and also throw in what we\'d like to see, too. We cook up new products. You never really know if people will love them as much as you do.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“There\'s an old Wayne Gretzky quote that I love. I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been. And we\'ve always tried to do that at Apple. Since the very, very beginning.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“You\'ve got to start with the customer experience and work backward to the Technology. You can\'t start with the technology and then try to figure out how to sell it.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“As we have tried to come up with a strategy and a vision for Apple, it started with “What incredible benefits can we give to the customer? Where can we take the customer?”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Part 1. There needs to be someone who is the keeper and reiterator of the vision. […] A lot of times, when you have to walk a thousand miles and you take the first step, it looks like a long way, and it really helps if there\'s someone there saying, “Well we\'re one step closer. The goal definitely exists; it\'s not just a mirage out there”.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Part 2. So in a thousand and one little, and sometimes larger ways, the vision needs to be reiterated. I do that a lot.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“When I got back here in 1997, I was looking for more room, and I found an archive of old Macs and other stuff. I said, \'Get it away!\' and I shipped all that shit off to Stanford. If you look backward in this business, you\'ll be crushed. You have to look forward.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“It\'s not about pop culture, and it\'s not about fooling people, and it\'s not about convincing people that they want something they don\'t. We figure out what we want. And I think we\'re pretty good at having the right discipline to think through whether a lot of other people are going to want it, too. That\'s what we get paid to do.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Even a great brand needs investment and caring if it\'s going to retain its relevance and vitality and the Apple brand has clearly suffered from neglect in this area in the last few years, and we need to bring it back. The way to do that is not to talk about speed and fees, it\'s not to talk about bits and mega-hertz, it\'s not to talk about why we are better than Windows.\nWhat does Nike do in their advertising? They honor great athletes, and they honor great athletics. That\'s who they are, that\'s what they are about.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“More important than building a product, we are in the process of architecting a company that will hopefully be much more incredible, the total will be much more incredible than the sum of its parts.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water or do you want a chance to change the world?”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“My dream is that every person in the world will have their own Apple computer. To do that, we\'ve got to be a great marketing company.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I\'ll tell you what our goal is: our goal is to make the best personal computers in the world and to make products we are proud to sell and recommend to our family and friends, and, we want to do that at the lowest price we can.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Our goal is to make the best personal computers in the world.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We have a major opportunity to influence where Apple is going. As every day passes, the work fifty people are doing here is going to send a giant ripple through the universe. I am really impressed with the quality of our ripple. I know I might be a little hard to get on with, but this is the most fun I\'ve had in my life. I\'m having a blast.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We attract a different kind of person - a person who doesn\'t want to wait five or ten years to have someone take a giant risk on him or her. Someone who really wants to get a little over his head and make a little dent in the universe.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“My job is to say when something sucks rather than sugarcoat it.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“What I\'m best at doing is finding a group of talented people and making things with them.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“What I do all day, is meet with teams of people, and work on ideas, and solve problems, to make new products, to make new marketing programs, whatever it is.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“The greatest people are self-managing - they don\'t need to be managed. Once they know what to do, they\'ll go figure out how to do it. What they need is a common vision. And that\'s what leadership is: [h]aving a vision; being able to articulate that so the people around you can understand it; and getting a consensus on a common vision.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Somebody once told me, “Manage the top line, and the bottom line will follow.” What\'s the top line? It\'s things like, why are we doing this in the first place? What\'s our strategy? What are customers saying? How responsive are we? Do we have the best products and the best people? Those are the kind of questions you have to focus on.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We\'ve got 25,000 people at Apple. About 10,000 of them are in the stores. And my job is to work with sort of the top 100 people, that\'s what I do. That doesn\'t mean they\'re all vice presidents. Some of them are just key individual contributors.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“When a good idea comes, you know, part of my job is to move it around, just see what different people think, get people talking about it, argue with people about it, get ideas moving among that group of 100 people, get different people together to explore different aspects of it quietly, and, you know - just explore things.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Companies, as they grow to become multi-billion-dollar entities, somehow lose their vision. They insert lots of layers of middle management between the people running the company and the people doing the work. They no longer have an inherent feel or a passion about the products.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“The people who are doing the work are the moving force behind the Macintosh. My job is to create a space for them, to clear out the rest of the organization and keep it at bay.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“My job is not to be easy on people. My job is to make them better.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“My job is to pull things together from different parts of the company and clear the ways and get the resources for the key projects. And to take these great people we have and to push them and make them even better, coming up with more aggressive visions of how it could be.\nIt doesn\'t make sense to hire smart people and tell them what to do; we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I want to see what people are like under pressure.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“If they fall in love with Apple, everything else will take care of itself. They\'ll want to do what\'s best for Apple, not what\'s best for them, what\'s best for Steve, or anybody else.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We hire people who want to make the best things in the world. You\'d be surprised how hard people work over around here. They work nights and weekends, sometimes not seeing their families for a while. Sometimes people work through Christmas to make sure the tooling is just right at some factory in some corner of the world so our product comes out the best it can be. People care so much, and it shows.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“They have to be really smart. But the real issue for me is, are they going to fall in love with Apple?”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“All we are is our ideas or people. That\'s what keeps us going to work in the morning, to hang around these great bright people. I\'ve always thought that recruiting is the heart and soul of what we do.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“The secret of my success is that we have gone to exceptional lengths to hire the best people in the world. And when you\'re in a field where the dynamic range is 25 to 1, boy, does it pay off.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Recruiting is hard. It\'s just finding the needles in the haystack.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We do it ourselves and we spend a lot of time at it. I\'ve participated in the hiring of maybe 5,000+ people in my life. So I take it very seriously.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“You can\'t know enough in a one-hour interview. So, in the end, it\'s ultimately based on your gut. How do I feel about this person? What are they like when they\'re challenged? Why are they here? I ask everybody that: \'Why are you here?\' The answers themselves are not what you\'re looking for. It\'s the meta-data.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“My number one job here at Apple is to make sure that the top 100 people are A+ players. And everything else will take care of itself.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Many times in an interview I will purposely upset someone: I\'ll criticize their prior work. I\'ll do my homework, find out what they worked on, and say, “God, that really turned out to be a bomb. That really turned out to be a bozo product. Why did you work on that?…”.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I want to see if they just fold or if they have firm conviction, belief, and pride in what they did.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Well, they\'re just yardsticks, you know.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“You should never start a company with the goal of getting rich. Your goal should be making something you believe in and making a company that will last.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I think money is a wonderful thing because it enables you to do things, it enables you to invest in ideas that don\'t have a short-term payback and things like that.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“It\'s very interesting, I was worth about over a million dollars when I was 23 and over 10 million when I was 24 and over a hundred million when I was 25 and it wasn\'t that important because I never did it for the money.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“But especially at that point in my life it was not the most important thing, the most important thing was the company, the people, the products we were making, what we were going to enable people to do with these products so I didn\'t think about it a great deal, and I never sold any stock, just really believe that the company would do very well over the long term.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Bottom line is, I didn\'t return to Apple to make a fortune. I\'ve been very lucky in my life and already have one.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“When I was 25, my net worth was $100 million or so. I decided then that I wasn\'t going to let it ruin my life. There\'s no way you could ever spend it all, and I don\'t view wealth as something that validates my intelligence.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I\'m not going to let it ruin my life. Isn\'t it kind of funny? You know, my main reaction to this money thing is that it\'s humorous, all the attention to it, because it\'s hardly the most insightful or valuable thing that\'s happened to me in the past ten years.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“It makes me feel old, sometimes, when I speak at a campus and I find that what students are most in awe of is the fact that I\'m a millionaire.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Well, they\'re just yardsticks, you know. The neatest thing was, by 1979, I was able to walk into classrooms that had 15 Apple computers and see the kids using them. And those are the kinds of things that are really the milestones.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“None of those people care about the money. I mean, a lot of them made a lot of money, but they don\'t really care. Their lifestyles haven\'t particularly changed. It was the chance to actually try something, to fail, to succeed, to grow.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“To me, marketing is about values.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“It\'s a very complicated world. It\'s a very noisy world. And we not gonna get a chance to get people to remember much about us. No company is. So we have to be really clear on what we want them to know about us.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We don\'t stand a chance of advertising with features and benefits and with RAMs and with charts and comparisons. The only chance we have of communicating is with a feeling.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“You can\'t just ask customers what they want and then try to give that to them. By the time you get it built, they\'ll want something new.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We have no idea how far it\'s going to go.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Humans are tool builders. We create things to amplify ourselves. The computer will rank at the top - it\'s the most awesome tool ever.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“What a computer is to me is the most remarkable tool that we have ever come up with. It\'s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We think basically you watch television to turn your brain off, and you work on your computer when you want to turn your brain on.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I think everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer, should learn a computer language because it teaches you how to think.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Talking about bicycles: Human are tool builders, and we build tools that can dramatically amplify our innate human abilities. We actually ran an ad like this early at Apple that the personal computer is the bicycle of the mind and I believe that with every bone in my body that all the inventions of humans, the computer is going to rank near, if not at the top, as history unfolds and we look back.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“It is the most awesome tool that we ever invented (the computer). And I feel incredibly lucky to be at exactly the right place in Silicon Valley, at exactly the right time historically where this invention has taken form.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“A computer is the most incredible tool we\'ve ever seen. It can be a writing tool, a communications center, a super calculator, a planner, a filer and an artistic instrument all in one, just by being given new instructions, or software, to work from. There are no other tools that have the power and versatility of a computer.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Right now, computers make our lives easier. They do work for us in fractions of a second that would take us hours. They increase the quality of life, some of that by simply automating drudgery and some of that by broadening our possibilities. As things progress, they\'ll be doing more and more for us.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“These technologies can make life easier, can let us touch people we might not otherwise. You may have a child with a birth defect and be able to get in touch with other parents and support groups, get medical information, the latest experimental drugs. These things can profoundly influence life. I\'m not downplaying that.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I think it\'s brought the world a lot closer together, and will continue to do that. There are downsides to everything; there are unintended consequences to everything. The most corrosive piece of technology that I\'ve ever seen is called television - but then, again, television, at its best, is magnificent.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“On how will the Web impact our society: We live in an information economy, but I don\'t believe we live in an information society. People are thinking less than they used to. It\'s primarily because of television. People are reading less and they\'re certainly thinking less.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I don\'t see most people using the Web to get more information. We\'re already in information overload. No matter how much information the Web can dish out, most people get far more information than they can assimilate anyway.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“But the next thing is going to be computer as guide or agent. And what that means is that it\'s going to do more in terms of anticipating what we want and doing it for us, noticing connections and patterns in what we do, asking us if this is some sort of generic thing we\'d like to do regularly, so that we\'re going to have, as an example, the concept of triggers.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We\'re going to be able to ask our computers to monitor things for us, and when certain conditions happen, are triggered, the computers will take certain actions and inform us after the fact.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“The point is that tools are always going to be used for certain things we don\'t find personally pleasing. And it\'s ultimately the wisdom of people, not the tools themselves, that is going to determine whether or not these things are used in positive, productive ways.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I do feel there is another way we have an effect on society besides our computers.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“One of the things that made Apple great was that, in the early days, it was built from the heart.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“And boy, have we patented it. (First announcement of the iPhone, Macworld 2006)”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“The roots of Apple were to build computers for people, not for corporations. The world doesn\'t need another Dell or Compaq.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“You know, everybody has a cell phone, but I don\'t know one person who likes their cell phone. I want to make a phone that people love.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“What if Apple didn\'t exist? Think about it. Time wouldn\'t get published next week. Some 70% of the newspaper in the U.S. wouldn\'t publish tomorrow morning. Some 60% of the kids wouldn\'t have computers; 64% of the teachers wouldn\'t have computers. More than half the Websites created on Macs wouldn\'t exist. So there\'s something worth saving here. See?”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“What are the great brands? Levi\'s, Coke, Disney, Nike. Most people would put Apple in that category. You could spend billions of dollars building a brand not as good as Apple. Yet Apple hasn\'t been doing anything with this incredible asset.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“What is Apple, after all? Apple is about people who think \'outside the box\", people who want to use computers to help them change the world, to help them create things that make a difference, and not just to get a job done.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Apple\'s the only company left in this industry that designs the whole widget. Hardware, software, developer relations, marketing.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything. It\'s very fortunate if you can work on just one of these in your career. Apple\'s been very fortunate in that it\'s introduced a few of these.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“What we want to do is make a leapfrog product that is way smarter than any mobile device has ever been, and super-easy to use. This is what iPhone is. OK? So, we\'re going to reinvent the phone.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I had this idea of being able to get rid of the keyboard, type on a multi-touch glass display, and I asked our folks, “Could we come up with a multi-touch display?”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We designed iMac to deliver the things consumers care about most: the excitement of the Internet and the simplicity of the Mac.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“It\'s not about charisma and personality, it\'s about results and products and those very bedrock things that are why people at Apple and outside of Apple are getting more excited about the company and what Apple stands for and what its potential is to contribute to the industry.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Talking about the iPod Nano: We\'re in uncharted territory. We\'ve never sold this many of anything before.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I\'ve always been attracted to the more revolutionary changes.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“It\'s very easy to take credit for the thinking. The doing is more concrete. But somebody, it\'s very easy to say “Oh, I thought of these three years ago”. But usually when you dig a little deeper, you find that the people that really did it were also the people that really worked through the hard intellectual problems as well.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Innovation has nothing to do with how many R&D dollars you have. When Apple came up with the Mac, IBM was spending at least 100 times more on R&D. It\'s not about money. It\'s about the people you have, how you\'re led, and how much you get it.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I discovered that the best innovation is sometimes the company, the way you organize a company. The whole notion of how you build a company is fascinating.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Leonardo [da Vinci] was the artist but he also mixed all his own paints. He also was a fairly good chemist. He knew about pigments, knew about human anatomy. And combining all of those skills together, the art and the science, the thinking and the doing, was what resulted in the exceptional result.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“When companies get bigger they try to replicate their success. But they assume their magic came from process.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Actually, making an insanely great product has a lot to do with the process of making the product, how you learn things and adopt new ideas and throw out old ideas.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“People get stuck as they get older. Our minds are sort of electrochemical computers. Your thoughts construct patterns like scaffolding in your mind. You are really etching chemical patterns. In most cases, people get stuck in those patterns, just like grooves in a record, and they never get out of them. It\'s a rare person who etches grooves that are other than a specific way of looking at things, a specific way of questioning things.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“You always have to keep pushing to innovate. Dylan could have sung protest songs forever and probably made a lot of money, but he didn\'t. He had to move on, and when he did, by going electric in 1965, he alienated a lot of people. His 1966 Europe tour was his greatest.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“The Beatles were the same way. They kept evolving, moving, refining their art. That\'s what I\'ve always tried to do - keep moving. Otherwise, as Dylan says, if you are not busy being born, you\'re busy dying.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower. (Related: Five Ways to Innovate Faster, hbr.org)”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I don\'t think that my role in life is to run big organizations and do incremental improvements.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I have a great respect for incremental improvement, and I\'ve done that sort of thing in my life, but I\'ve always been attracted to the more revolutionary changes. I don\'t know why. Because they\'re harder. They\'re much more stressful emotionally. And you usually go through a period where everybody tells you that you\'ve completely failed.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“The people who go to see our movies are trusting us with something very important - their time and their imagination. So in order to respect that trust, we have to keep changing; we have to challenge ourselves and try to surprise our audiences with something new every time.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Innovation comes from people meeting up in the hallways or calling each other at 10:30 at night with a new idea, or because they realized something that shoots holes in how we\'ve been thinking about a problem.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“It\'s ad hoc meetings of six people called by someone who thinks he has figured out the coolest new thing ever and who wants to know what other people think of his idea.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“You can\'t go out and ask people, you know, what the next big thing is. There\'s a great quote by Henry Ford, right? He said, \'If I\'d have asked my customers what they wanted, they would have told me \'A faster horse\'.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Sometimes when you innovate, you make mistakes. It is best to admit them quickly and get on with improving your other innovations.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“The theme of the campaign is \'Think different\'. It\'s honoring the people who think different, and who move this world forward.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Apple is built on refugees from other companies. These are the extremely bright individual contributors who were troublemakers at other companies.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“The people who made Mac are sort of on the edge.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“On if he is a nerd or a hippie: If I had to pick one of those two I\'m clearly a hippie. All the people that I worked with were clearly in that category too.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I think the artistry is in having an insight into what one sees around them. Generally putting things together in a way no one else has before and finding a way to express that to other people who don\'t have that insight.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Creativity is just connecting things.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I don\'t think that most of the really best people that I\'ve worked with worked with computers for the sake of working with computers. They worked with computers because they are the medium that is best capable of transmitting some feeling that you have, that you want to share with other people.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“What I do see is a small group of people who are artists and care more about their art than they do about almost anything else. It\'s more important than finding a girlfriend, it\'s more important… than cooking a meal, it\'s more important than joining the Marines, it\'s more important than whatever.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Look at the way artists work. They\'re not typically the most \'balanced\' people in the world. Now, yes, we have a few workaholics here who are trying to escape other things, of course. But the majority of people out here have made very conscious decisions; they really have.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“It\'s rare that you see an artist in his 30s or 40s able to really contribute something amazing. Of course, there are some people who are innately curious, forever little kids in their awe of life, but they\'re rare.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“You\'ve baked a really lovely cake, but then you\'ve used dog shit for frosting.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“The broader one\'s understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Design is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I want it to be as beautiful as possible, even if it\'s inside the box. A great carpenter isn\'t going to use lousy wood for the back of a cabinet, even though nobody\'s going to see it.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“To design something really well, you have to get it. You have to really grok what it\'s all about. It takes a passionate commitment to really thoroughly understand something, chew it up, not just quickly swallow it. Most people don\'t take the time to do that.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Many companies forget what it means to make great products. After initial success, sales and marketing people take over and the product people eventually make their way out.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“When you\'re a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you\'re not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall and nobody will ever see it. You\'ll know it\'s there, so you\'re going to use a beautiful piece of wood on the back.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I love it when you can bring really great design and simple capability to something that doesn\'t cost much. It was the original vision for Apple. That\'s what we tried to do with the first Mac. That\'s what we did with the iPod.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“It takes a lot of hard work to make something simple, to truly understand the underlying challenges and come up with elegant solutions.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“A lot of people in our industry haven\'t had very diverse experiences. So they don\'t have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We will make them bright and pure and honest about being high-tech, rather than a heavy industrial look of black, black, black, black, like Sony.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We spent some time in our family talking about what\'s the trade-off we want to make. We ended up talking a lot about design, but also about the values of our family. Did we care most about getting our wash done in an hour versus an hour and a half? Or did we care most about our clothes feeling really soft and lasting longer? Did we care about using a quarter of the water?”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We spent two weeks talking about this every night at the dinner table. We\'d get around to that old washer-dryer discussion. And the talk was about design.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“People think it\'s this veneer - that the designers are handed this box and told, \'Make it look good!\' That\'s not what we think design is. It\'s not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“You\'re asking, where does aesthetic judgment come from? With many things: high-performance automobiles, for example, the aesthetic comes right from the function, and I suppose electronics is no different.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I\'ve also found that the best companies pay attention to aesthetics. They take the extra time to lay out grids and proportion things appropriately, and it seems to pay off for them. I mean, beyond the functional benefits, the aesthetic communicates something about how they think of themselves, their sense of discipline in engineering, how they run their company, stuff like that.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“It\'s really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don\'t know what they want until you show it to them.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Designing a product is keeping five thousand things in your brain, these concepts and fitting them all together in kind of continuing to push to fit them together in new and different ways to get what you want.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Every day you discover something new that is a new problem or a new opportunity to fit these things together a little differently.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I have always found Buddhism - Japanese Zen Buddhism in particular - to be aesthetically sublime. The most sublime thing I\'ve ever seen are the gardens around Kyoto.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Look at the Mercedes design, the proportion of sharp detail to flowing lines. Over the years, they have made the design softer but the details starker. That\'s what we have to do with the Macintosh.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“You\'ve got to start with the customer experience and work backward to the technology.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“What we\'re trying to do is remove the barrier of having to learn how to use a computer.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“This is what customers pay us for - to sweat all these details so it\'s easy and pleasant for them to use our computers. We\'re supposed to be really good at this. That doesn\'t mean we don\'t listen to customers.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“It\'s hard for them to tell you what they want when they\'ve never seen anything remotely like it. Take desktop video editing.

Otherwise, you can get great pieces of technology all floating around the universe. But it doesn\'t add up to much.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We did iTunes because we all love music. We made what we thought was the best jukebox in iTunes. Then we all wanted to carry our whole music libraries around with us. The team worked really hard.

But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We wanted to more richly experience why were we were alive, not just make a better life, and so people went in search of things.

I\'m trying to educate myself, being from a small town in California, not having grown up with the sophistication and culture of a large city. I consider it part of my education.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I used to think that technology could help education. I\'ve probably spearheaded giving away more computer equipment to schools than anybody else on the planet. But I\'ve had to come to the inevitable conclusion that the problem is not one that technology can hope to solve. What\'s wrong with education cannot be fixed with technology. No amount of technology will make a dent.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“The most important thing is a person. A person who incites and feeds your curiosity; and machines cannot do that in the same way that people can.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“One of the saints in my life is this woman named Imogene Hill, who was a fourth-grade teacher who taught this advanced class.

I learned more that year than I think I learned in any year in school.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I was pretty bored in school, and I turned into a little terror. You should have seen us in third grade. We basically destroyed our teacher. We would let snakes loose in the classroom and explode bombs.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“School was pretty hard for me at the beginning.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“My mother taught me how to read before I got to school and so when I got there I really just wanted to do two things. I wanted to read books because I loved reading books and I wanted to go outside and chase butterflies. You know, do the things that five-year-olds like to do. I encountered authority of a different kind than I had ever encountered before, and I did not like it. And they really almost got me. They came close to really beating any curiosity out of me.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Obviously, one of the great challenges of an education is to teach us how to think. What we\'re finding is that computers are actually going to affect the quality of thinking as more and more of our children have these tools available to them.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I know from my own education that if I hadn\'t encountered two or three individuals that spent extra time with me, I\'m sure I would have been in jail.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“When you\'re young, a little bit of course correction goes a long way. I think it takes pretty talented people to do that.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“If you just sit and observe, you will see how restless your mind is. If you try to calm it, it only makes it worse, but over time it does calm, and when it does, there\'s room to hear more subtle things - that\'s when your intuition starts to blossom and you start to see things more clearly and be in the present more. Your mind just slows down, and you see a tremendous expanse in the moment. You see so much more than you could see before.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Focusing is about saying no.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Just get rid of the crappy stuff and focus on the good stuff.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We try to focus and do very few things well. And focusing is hard because focusing doesn\'t mean saying yes, it means saying no. So we decide not to do a lot of things so we can focus on a handful of things and do them well.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it\'s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I have a very simple life. I have my family and I have Apple and Pixar.

It\'s really clear that the most precious resource we all have is time. As it is, I pay a price by not having much of a personal life. I don\'t have the time to pursue love affairs or to tour small towns in Italy and sit in cafés and eat tomato-and-mozzarella salad.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I end up not buying a lot of things, because I find them ridiculous.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“The way we\'re running the company, the product design, the advertising, it all comes down to this: Let\'s make it simple. Really simple.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Look at the design of a lot of consumer products - they\'re really complicated surfaces. We tried to make something much more holistic and simple.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“When you first start off trying to solve a problem, the first solutions you come up with are very complex, and most people stop there. But if you keep going, and live with the problem and peel more layers of the onion off, you can oftentimes arrive at some very elegant and simple solutions. Most people just don\'t put in the time or energy to get there.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We believe that customers are smart and want objects which are well thought through.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“What I found when I got here was a zillion and one products. It was amazing. And I started to ask people, now why would I recommend a 3400 over a 4400? When should somebody jump up to a 6500, but not a 7300? And after three weeks, I couldn\'t figure this out. If I couldn\'t figure this out… how could our customers figure this out?”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Apple is a $30 billion company, yet we\'ve got less than 30 major products. I don\'t know if that\'s ever been done before. Certainly the great consumer electronics companies of the past had thousands of products. We tend to focus much more. People think focus means saying yes to the thing you\'ve got to focus on. But that\'s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We\'re always thinking about new markets we could enter, but it\'s only by saying no that you can concentrate on the things that are really important.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Quality is more important than quantity. One home run is much better than two doubles.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We had a fundamental belief that doing it right the first time was going to be easier than having to go back and fix it.

The Zune was crappy because the people at Microsoft don\'t really love music or art the way we do. We won because we personally love music.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I am saddened, not by Microsoft success, I have no problem with their success, they\'ve earned their success, for the most part. I have a problem with the fact that they just make really third-rate products.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Their products have no spirit of enlightenment about them, they are very pedestrian. The sad part is that customers don\'t have a lot of that spirit either, but the way that we\'re going to ratchet up our species is to take the best and to spread it around everybody so that everybody grows up with better things and starts to understand the subtlety of these better things.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I wish him the best, I really do.

And now they are completely lost.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“With our technology, with objects, literally three people in a garage can blow away what 200 people at Microsoft can do.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Our friends up north spend over five billion dollars on research and development and all they seem to do is copy Google and Apple.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Steve Job\'s final words\n“OH WOW.

While we have this body, and especially this amazing human brain, I think every minute is something precious.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“There are two kinds of compassion. The first comes from a natural concern for friends and family who are close to us. This has limited range but can be the seed for something bigger. We can also learn to extend a genuine concern for others' well-being, whoever they are. That is real compassion, and only human beings are capable of developing it.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“Given the scale of life in the cosmos, one human life is no more than a tiny blip. Each one of us is a just visitor to this planet, a guest, who will only stay for a limited time. What greater folly could there be than to spend this short time alone, unhappy or in conflict with our companions?

This can put our life back in proper context, allow a fresh perspective, and enable us to see which direction to take.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“It is under the greatest adversity that there exists the greatest potential for doing good, both for oneself and others.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“Hard times build determination and inner strength. Through them we can also come to appreciate the uselessness of anger.

If you find some point which may be suitable to you, then you can carry out experiments for yourself. If you find that it is of no use, then you can discard it.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“Look at children. Of course they may quarrel, but generally speaking they do not harbor ill feelings as much or as long as adults do. Most adults have the advantage of education over children, but what is the use of an education if they show a big smile while hiding negative feelings deep inside? Children don't usually act in such a manner. If they feel angry with someone, they express it, and then it is finished. They can still play with that person the following day.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“Only the development of compassion and understanding for others can bring us the tranquility and happiness we all seek.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“In our struggle for freedom, truth is the only weapon we possess.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“There is a saying in Tibetan, 'Tragedy should be utilized as a source of strength'.

When we make mistakes, we cannot turn the clock back and try again. All we can do is use the present well.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“Appearance is something absolute, but reality is not that way - everything is interdependent, not absolute. So that view is very helpful to maintain a peace of mind because the main destroyer of a peaceful mind is anger.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“Because motivation pervades all action, it is important that we have a positive motivation. Whatever we are involved in, whether it's politics, education, medicine, law, engineering, science, business or industry, the nature of our motivation determines the character of our work.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“We are the controller of the technology. If we become a slave of technology, then that's not good.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“Ethics are not a collection of commandments and prohibitions to abide by, but a natural inner offering that can bring happiness and satisfaction to ourselves and others.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“It is very rare or almost impossible that an event can be negative from all points of view.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“I don't dwell on being the Dalai Lama, I think of myself as just another human being. And when I meet someone else I greet them as a brother or sister, which brings me joy. Self-centredness, being obsessed with ourselves, just brings us trouble.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“When you don't have much concern for others and you feel you're the center of the universe, you'll be dogged by feelings of suspicion left and right.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“We are deluded by attachment and anger, but we can learn to tackle these emotions.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“Develop the heart.

Those who attack labor forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Philanthropy is commendable, but it must not cause the philanthropist to overlook the circumstances of economic injustice which make philanthropy necessary.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“One who breaks an unjust law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“It may be true that the law cannot make a man love me, but it can keep him from lynching me, and I think that\'s pretty important.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“It is a tragic mix-up when the United States spends $500,000 for every enemy soldier killed, and only $53 annually on the victims of poverty.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“The time has come for an all-out world war against poverty. The rich nations must use their vast resources of wealth to develop the underdeveloped, school the unschooled, and feed the unfed. Ultimately a great nation is a compassionate nation.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“What good does it do to sit at the counter when you cannot afford a hamburger?”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“My obligation is to do the right thing. The rest is in God\'s hands.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“In a real sense faith is total surrender to God.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“To be a Christian without prayer is no more possible than to be alive without breathing.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Science investigates; religion interprets. Science gives man knowledge, which is power; religion gives man wisdom, which is control. Science deals mainly with facts; religion deals mainly with values. The two are not rivals.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Evil can be cast out, not by man alone nor by a dictatorial God who invades our lives, but when we open the door and invite God through Christ to enter.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Our only hope today lies in our ability to recapture the revolutionary spirit and go out into a sometimes hostile world declaring eternal hostility to poverty, racism, and militarism.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“If we are to go forward, we must go back and rediscover those precious values - that all reality hinges on moral foundations and that all reality has spiritual control.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“If you lose hope, somehow you lose the vitality that keeps life moving, you lose that courage to be, that quality that helps you go on in spite of it all. And so today I still have a dream.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“When people get caught up with that which is right and they are willing to sacrifice for it, there is no stopping point short of victory.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“So I\'m happy tonight. I\'m not worried about anything. I\'m not fearing any man. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord!”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“At times, life is hard, as hard as crucible steel. It has its bleak and painful moments. Like the ever flowing water of a river, life has its moments of drought and its moments of flood.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Like the ever-changing cycle of the seasons, life has the soothing warmth of the summers and the piercing chill of its winters.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“But through it all, God walks with us. Never forget that God is able to lift you from the fatigue of despair to the buoyancy of hope, and transform dark and desolate valleys into sunlit paths of inner peace.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“My faith in man is, at bottom, a faith in God.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Love is the only force capable of transforming an enemy into friend.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“There can be no deep disappointment where there is not deep love.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Everybody can be great… because anybody can serve. You don\'t have to have a college degree to serve. You don\'t have to make your subject and verb agree to serve. You only need a heart full of grace. A soul generated by love.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“In some not too distant tomorrow the radiant stars of love and brotherhood will shine over our great nation with all their scintillating beauty.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“This call for a worldwide fellowship that lifts neighborly concern beyond one\'s tribe, race, class and nation is in reality a call for an all-embracing and unconditional love for all men.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“This often misunderstood and misinterpreted concept has now become an absolute necessity for the survival of man.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“When I speak of love, I am speaking of that force which all the great religions have seen as the supreme unifying principle of life.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Love is the key that unlocks the door which leads to ultimate reality.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Power properly understood is nothing but the ability to achieve purpose… one of the great problems of history is that the concepts of love and power have usually been contrasted as opposites - polar opposites - so that love is identified with a resignation of power, and power with a denial of love.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“There is nothing more dangerous than to build a society with a large segment of people in that society who feel that they have no stake in it; who feel that that have nothing to lose. People who have stake in their society, protect that society, but when they don\'t have it, they unconsciously want to destroy it.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Make a career of humanity… It will enrich your spirit as nothing else possibly can. It will give you that rare sense of nobility that can only spring from love and selflessly helping your fellow man… You will make a greater person of yourself, a greater nation of your country, and a finer world to live in.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Whenever you are engaged in work that serves humanity and is for the building of humanity, it has dignity and it has worth.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Hatred paralyzes life; love releases it. Hatred confuses life; love harmonizes it. Hatred darkens life; love illuminates it.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“I am convinced that love is the most durable power in the world. It is not an expression of impractical idealism, but of practical realism.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Far from being the pious injunction of a Utopian dreamer, love is an absolute necessity for the survival of our civilization. To return hate for hate does nothing but intensify the existence of evil in the universe.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Someone must have sense enough and religion enough to cut off the chain of hate and evil, and this can only be done through love.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Forgiveness does not mean ignoring what has been done or putting a false label on an evil act. It means, rather, that the evil act no longer remains as a barrier to the relationship. Forgiveness is a catalyst creating the atmosphere necessary for a fresh start and a new beginning.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“A genuine revolution of values means in the final analysis that our loyalties must become ecumenical rather than sectional. Every nation must now develop an overriding loyalty to mankind as a whole in order to preserve the best in their individual societies.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“We must develop and maintain the capacity to forgive. He who is devoid of the power to forgive is devoid of the power to love.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“There is some good in the worst of us and some evil in the best of us. When we discover this, we are less prone to hate our enemies.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality. This is why right, temporarily defeated, is stronger than evil triumphant.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Man must evolve for all human conflict a method which rejects revenge, aggression and retaliation. The foundation of such a method is love.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“We have before us the glorious opportunity to inject a new dimension of love into the veins of our civilization.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Not everybody can be famous but everybody can be great, because greatness is determined by service.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Only in the darkness can you see the stars.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“I feel that the people of ill will have used time much more effectively than have the people of good will.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Darkness cannot be overcome with more darkness, only with light. Violence cannot be overcome with more violence, only with peace.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“I mourn the loss of thousands of precious lives, but I will not rejoice in the death of one, not even an enemy. Returning hate, adding deeper darkness to a night that is already void of stars.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“We may cry out desperately for time to pause in her passage, but time is deaf to every plea and rushes on. Over the bleached bones and jumbled residues of numerous civilizations are written the pathetic words: \'Too late\'.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Procrastination is still the thief of time. Life often leaves us standing bare, naked and dejected with a lost opportunity.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual doom.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Have we not come to such an impasse in the modern world that we must love our enemies - or else? The chain reaction of evil - hate begetting hate, wars producing more wars - must be broken, or else we shall be plunged into the dark abyss of annihilation.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“There is little hope for us until we become tough-minded enough to break loose from the shackles of prejudice, half-truths, and downright ignorance. The shape of the world today does not permit us the luxury of soft mindedness.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“A nation or civilization that continues to produce soft-minded men purchases its own spiritual death on the installment plan.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“He who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it. He who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Never succumb to the temptation of bitterness.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Never forget that everything Hitler did in Germany was legal.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“We stand in life at midnight; we are always at the threshold of a new dawn.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“A riot is the language of the unheard.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“War is a poor chisel to carve out tomorrow.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Stumbling and groping through the wilderness finally must be replaced by a planned, organized and orderly march.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“The past is prophetic in that it asserts loudly that wars are poor chisels for carving out peaceful tomorrows.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“If you succumb to the temptation of using violence in the struggle, unborn generations will be the recipients of a long and desolate night of bitterness, and your chief legacy to the future will be an endless reign of meaningless chaos.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Violence as a way of achieving racial justice is both impractical and immoral. It is impractical because it is a descending spiral ending in destruction for all. The old law of an eye for an eye leaves everybody blind. It is immoral because it seeks to humiliate the opponent rather than win his understanding; it seeks to annihilate rather than to convert.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Violence is immoral because it thrives on hatred rather than love. It destroys community and makes brotherhood impossible. It leaves society in monologue rather than dialogue.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Violence ends by defeating itself. It creates bitterness in the survivors and brutality in the destroyers.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Like an unchecked cancer, hate corrodes the personality and eats away its vital unity. Hate destroys a man\'s sense of values and his objectivity. It causes him to describe the beautiful as ugly and the ugly as beautiful, and to confuse the true with the false and the false with the true.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“The limitation of riots, moral questions aside, is that they cannot win and their participants know it. Hence, rioting is not revolutionary but reactionary because it invites defeat. It involves an emotional catharsis, but it must be followed by a sense of futility.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“The more there are riots, the more repressive action will take place, and the more we face the danger of a right-wing takeover and eventually a fascist society.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“One of the greatest casualties of the war in Vietnam is the Great Society… shot down on the battlefield of Vietnam.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“The ultimate weakness of violence is that it is a descending spiral, begetting the very thing it seeks to destroy. Instead of diminishing evil, it multiplies it.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Through violence you may murder the liar, but you cannot murder the lie, nor establish the truth. Through violence you murder the hater, but you do not murder hate. In fact, violence merely increases hate. Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“In spite of temporary victories, violence never brings permanent peace.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“At the center of non-violence stands the principle of love.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Peace is not merely a distant goal that we seek, but a means by which we arrive at that goal.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“We still have a choice today: nonviolent coexistence or violent coannihilation. This may well be mankind\'s last chance to choose between chaos and community.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“We who in engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“I refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“We must concentrate not merely on the negative expulsion of war but the positive affirmation of peace.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Those who love peace must learn to organize as effectively as those who love war.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“The choice is not between violence and nonviolence but between nonviolence and nonexistence.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Here is the true meaning and value of compassion and nonviolence, when it helps us to see the enemy\'s point of view, to hear his questions, to know his assessment of ourselves.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“For from his view we may indeed see the basic weaknesses of our own condition, and if we are mature, we may learn and grow and profit from the wisdom of the brothers who are called the opposition.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Nonviolence is a powerful and just weapon, which cuts without wounding and ennobles the man who wields it. It is a sword that heals.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Nonviolence is the answer to the crucial political and moral questions of our time; the need for mankind to overcome oppression and violence without resorting to oppression and violence.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Nonviolence means avoiding not only external physical violence but also internal violence of spirit. You not only refuse to shoot a man, but you refuse to hate him.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“We adopt the means of nonviolence because our end is a community at peace with itself. We will try to persuade with our words, but if our words fail, we will try to persuade with our acts.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“It is not enough to say we must not wage war. It is necessary to love peace and sacrifice for it.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Peace is not simply the absence of conflict, but the existence of justice for all people.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“The silence of the good people is more dangerous than the brutally of the bad people.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“It\'s not the violence of the few that scares me, it\'s the silence of the many.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“The ultimate tragedy is not the oppression and cruelty by the bad people but the silence over that by the good people.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“History will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clamor of the bad people, but the appalling silence of the good people.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr"};

Is it a fear of the comfortable life, or nice furniture, of dishonor that I burden myself with, or even the fear of becoming a contented bourgeois?”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“Marriage makes people treat each other as articles of property and no longer as free human beings.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“Marriage is but slavery made to appear civilized.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“One must take what nature gives as one finds it.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“Joy in looking and comprehending is nature\'s most beautiful gift.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“How wretchedly inadequate is the theoretical physicist as he stands before Nature, and before his students.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“My scientific work is motivated by an irresistible longing to understand the secrets of nature and by no other feelings.

Nature is not an engineer or a contractor, and I myself am a part of Nature.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“Occurrences in this domain are beyond the reach of exact prediction because of the variety of factors in operation, not because of any lack of order in nature.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“Numerous are the wares that nature produces by the dozen, but her choice products are few.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“Space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind union of the two will preserve an independent reality.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“A spirit is manifest in the laws of the universe, a spirit vastly superior to that of man, and one in the face of which we with our modest powers must feel humble.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“If the bee disappeared off the surface of the globe, then man would have only four years of life left. No more bees, no more pollination, no more plants, no more animals, no more man. (See Quote Investigator for the source)”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“I sometimes ask myself how it came about that I was the one to develop the theory of relativity. The reason, I think, is that a normal adult never stops to think about problems of space and time. These are things which he has thought about as a child.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“What I see is a certain something, desolate and grey as infinity.

Also, it is natural for a serious young man to envision his desired goals with the greatest possible precision.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“Reading, after a certain age, diverts the mind too much from its creative pursuits.

This is a somewhat new kind of religion.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“Before God we are all equally wise - and equally foolish.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“A religious person is devout in the sense that he has no doubt about the significance of those superpersonal objects and goals which neither require nor are capable of rational foundation.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“What really interests me is whether God had any choice in the creation of the world.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“The further the spiritual evolution of mankind advances, the more certain it seems to me that the path to genuine religiosity does not lie through the fear of life, and the fear of death, and blind faith, but through striving after rational knowledge.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“True religion is real living; living with all one\'s soul, with all one\'s goodness and righteousness.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“My religion consists of a humble admiration of the illimitable superior spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble mind.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“My religiosity consists in a humble admiration of the infinitely superior spirit that reveals itself in the little that we, with our weak and transitory understanding, can comprehend of reality.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“Through the reading of popular scientific books, I soon reached the conviction that much in the stories of the Bible could not be true. The consequence was a positively fanatic orgy of freethinking coupled with the impression that youth is intentionally being deceived by the state through lies; it was a crushing impression.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“Though I am now an old fogey, I am still hard at work and still refuse to believe that God plays dice.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“Strenuous intellectual work and looking at God\'s nature are the reconciling, fortifying, yet relentlessly strict angels that shall lead me through all of life\'s troubles.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“God does not care about our mathematical difficulties.

Veneration for this force beyond anything that we can comprehend is my religion. To that extent I am, in point of fact, religious.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“That deep emotional conviction of the presence of a superior reasoning power, which is revealed in the incomprehensible universe, forms my idea of God.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“I cannot imagine a God who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation and is but a reflection of human frailty.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“All religions, arts and sciences are branches of the same tree.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“Whoever undertakes to set himself up as a judge of Truth and Knowledge is shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“God gave me the stubbornness of a mule and a fairly keen scent.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“The measure of intelligence is the ability to change.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“We will not change the hearts of other men by mechanisms, but by changing our hearts and speaking bravely… When we are clear in heart and mind - only then - shall we find courage to surmount the fear which haunts the world.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“All that is valuable in human society depends upon the opportunity for development accorded the individual.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“The world as we have created it is a process of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“A photograph never grows old. You and I change, people change all through the months and years but a photograph always remains the same. How nice to look at a photograph of mother or father taken many years ago.

That is why I think a photograph can be kind.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“Nothing will benefit human health and increase chances of survival for life on earth as much as the evolution to a vegetarian diet.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“It is my view that the vegetarian manner of living by its purely physical effect on the human temperament would most beneficially influence the lot of mankind.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“Innovation is not the product of logical thought, although the result is tied to logical structure.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“Thinking is hard work; that\'s why so few do it.”\n\n- Albert Einstein", "“I must be willing to give up what I am in order to become what I will be.”\n\n- Albert Einstein"};

That was a time when every college student in this country read Be Here Now and Diet for a Small Planet - there were about ten books.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“On being fired from Apple and called back 12 years later: What a circle of life.

Even people who want to go to heaven don\'t want to die to get there.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be because death is very likely the single best invention of life. It is life\'s change agent, it clears out the old to make way for the new.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I\'ve always felt that death is the greatest invention of life. I\'m sure that life evolved without death at first and found that without death, life didn\'t work very well because it didn\'t make room for the young.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Even people who want to go to heaven don\'t want to die to get there.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Without death, there would be very little progress.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“So it\'s a lot of hard work and it\'s a lot of worrying constantly and if you don\'t love it, you\'re going to fail. So you\'ve got to love it and you\'ve got to have passion and I think that\'s the high-order bit.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I\'ve been rejected, but I was still in love.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I was lucky, I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents\' garage when I was 20.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“People say you have to have a lot of passion for what you\'re doing and it\'s totally true. And the reason is because it\'s so hard that if you don\'t, any rational person would give up. It\'s really hard. And you have to do it over a sustained period of time. So if you don\'t love it, if you\'re not having fun doing it, you don\'t really love it, you\'re going to give up.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“If you really look at the ones that ended up, you know, being “successful” in the eyes of society and the ones that didn\'t, oftentimes, it\'s the ones who were successful and loved what they did so they could persevere, you know, when it got really tough. And the ones that didn\'t love it quit because they\'re sane, right? Who would want to put up with this stuff if you don\'t love it?”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“That was one of the things that came out most clearly from this whole experience [with cancer]. I realized that I love my life. I really do. I\'ve got the greatest family in the world, and I\'ve got my work. And that\'s pretty much all I do. I don\'t socialize much or go to conferences. I love my family, and I love running Apple, and I love Pixar. And I get to do that. I\'m very lucky.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“You get your wind back, remember the finish line, and keep going.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“At Apple, people are putting in 18-hour days.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I\'m convinced that about half of what separates the successful entrepreneurs from the non-successful ones is pure perseverance. It is so hard. You put so much of your life into this thing. There are such rough moments in time that I think most people give up. I don\'t blame them. It\'s really tough and it consumes your life.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“If you\'ve got a family and you\'re in the early days of a company, I can\'t imagine how one could do it. I\'m sure it\'s been done but it\'s rough. It\'s pretty much an eighteen hour day job, seven days a week for awhile. Unless you have a lot of passion about this, you\'re not going to survive. You\'re going to give it up.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“You\'ve got to have an idea, or a problem or a wrong that you want to right that you\'re passionate about, otherwise you\'re not going to have the perseverance to stick it through. I think that\'s half the battle right there.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I\'ve read something that Bill Gates said about six months ago. He said, \'I worked really, really hard in my 20s.\' And I know what he means because I worked really, really hard in my 20s too. Literally, you know, 7 days a week, a lot of hours every day. And it actually is a wonderful thing to do, because you can get a lot done. But you can\'t do it forever, and you don\'t want to do it forever, and you have to come up with ways of figuring out what the most important things are and working with other people even more.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I don\'t think I\'ve ever worked so hard on something, but working on Macintosh was the neatest experience of my life. Almost everyone who worked on it will say that. None of us wanted to release it at the end.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“On the MacIntosh: When we finally presented it at the shareholders\' meeting, everyone in the auditorium gave it a five-minute ovation. What was incredible to me was that I could see the Mac team in the first few rows. It was as though none of us could believe we\'d actually finished it. Everyone started crying.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“As it was clear that the Sixties were over, it was also clear that a lot of the people who had gone through the Sixties ended up not really accomplishing what they set out to accomplish, and because they had thrown their discipline to the wind, they didn\'t have much to fall back on.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Pixar has been a marathon, not a sprint. There are times when you run a marathon and you wonder, why am I doing this? But you take a drink of water, and around the next bend, you get your wind back, remember the finish line, and keep going.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“On the MacIntosh: It was as though we knew that once it was out of our hands, it wouldn\'t be ours anymore.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“My wife deserves all the credit for keeping me at it.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I can tell you this: I\'ve been married for 8 years, and that\'s had a really good influence on me. I\'ve been very lucky, through random happenstance I just happened to sit next to this wonderful woman who became my wife. And it was a big deal. We have 3 kids, and it\'s been a big deal. You see the world differently.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I\'ve never been so tired in my life. I\'d come home at about ten o\'clock at night and flop straight into bed, then haul myself out at six the next morning and take a shower and go to work. My wife deserves all the credit for keeping me at it. She supported me and kept the family together with a husband in absentia.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Most people don\'t get those experiences because they never ask. I\'ve never found anybody that didn\'t want to help me if I asked them for help.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Most people never pick up the phone and call. Most people never ask. And that\'s what separates sometimes the people that do things from the people that just dream about them.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“As you may know, I was basically fired from Apple when I was 30 and was invited to come back 12 years later so that was difficult when it happened but maybe the best thing that could ever happen to me. […] you just move on, life goes on and you learn from it.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“If you act like you can do something, then it will work.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I feel like somebody just punched me in the stomach and knocked all my wind out. I\'m only 30 years old and I want to have a chance to continue creating things. I know I\'ve got at least one more great computer in me. And Apple is not going to give me a chance to do that.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We\'ve done so many hardware products where Jony and I have looked at each other and said, \'We don\'t know how to make it any better than this, we just don\'t know how to make it\'. But we always do; we realize another way. And then it\'s not long after the new thing comes out that we look at the older thing and go, \'How can we ever have done that?\"“\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Life goes on and you learn from it.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Each year has been so robust with problems and successes and learning experiences and human experiences that a year is a lifetime at Apple.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“When I was 12 or 13, I wanted to build something and I needed some parts, so I picked up the phone and called Bill Hewlett - he was listed in the Palo Alto phone book. He answered the phone and he was real nice. He chatted with me for, like, 20 minutes. He didn\'t know me at all, but he ended up giving me some parts and he got me a job that summer working at Hewlett-Packard on the line, assembling frequency counters. Assembling may be too strong. I was putting in screws. It didn\'t matter; I was in heaven.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I\'ve never found anyone who\'s said no or hung up the phone when I called-I just asked. And when people ask me, I try to be as responsive, to pay that debt of gratitude back.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“You gotta act. And you\'ve gotta be willing to fail, you gotta be ready to crash and burn, with people on the phone, with starting a company, with whatever. If you\'re afraid of failing, you won\'t get very far.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I believe life is an intelligent thing, that things aren\'t random.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“When you die, it doesn\'t just all disappear.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Sometimes I believe in God, sometimes I don\'t. I think it\'s 50-50 maybe.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Ever since I\'ve had cancer, I\'ve been thinking about it more. And I find myself believing a bit more. I kind of - maybe it\'s \'cause I want to believe in an afterlife. That when you die, it doesn\'t just all disappear. The wisdom you\'ve accumulated. Somehow it lives on, but sometimes I think it\'s just like an on-off switch. Click and you\'re gone. And that\'s why I don\'t like putting on-off switches on Apple devices.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I think different religions are different doors to the same house. Sometimes I think the house exists, and sometimes I don\'t. It\'s the great mystery.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“The most powerful person in business is the storyteller. The storyteller sets the vision, values, and agenda of an entire generation that is to come.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I\'m a long-term kind of person.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Fortunately, my training has been in doing things that take a long time. You know? I was at Apple 10 years. I would have preferred to be there the rest of my life. So I\'m a long-term kind of person.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I have been trained to think in units of time that are measured in several years. With what I\'ve chosen to do with my life, you know, even a small thing takes a few years. To do anything of magnitude takes at least five years, more likely seven or eight. Rightfully or wrongfully, that\'s how I think.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I hate it when people call themselves “entrepreneurs” when what they\'re really trying to do is launch a startup and then sell or go public, so they can cash in and move on.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I\'m a tool builder. That\'s how I think of myself. I want to build really good tools that I know in my gut and my heart will be valuable. And then, whatever happens, is… you can\'t really predict exactly what will happen, but you can feel the direction that we\'re going. And that\'s about as close as you can get. Then you just stand back and get out of the way, and these things take on a life of their own.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“If you are willing to work hard and ask lots of questions, you can learn business pretty fast.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“On starting Apple with Steve Wozniak: We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a 2 billion company with over 4000 employees.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I remember many late nights coming out of the Mac building when I would have the most incredibly powerful feelings about my life.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We used to dream about this stuff. Now we get to build it. It\'s pretty great.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“The smallest company in the world can look as large as the largest company on the web.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I think this is the start of something really big. Sometimes that first step is the hardest one, and we\'ve just taken it.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Another priority was to make Apple more entrepreneurial and startup-like. So we immediately reorganized, drastically narrowed the product line, and changed compensation for senior managers so they get a lot of stock but no cash bonuses. The upshot is that the place feels more like a young company.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“But it\'s a disservice to constantly put things in this radical new light - that it\'s going to change everything. Things don\'t have to change the world to be important.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We are aware that we are doing something significant. We\'re here at the beginning of it and we\'re able to shape how it goes.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Everyone here has the sense that right now is one of those moments when we are influencing the future.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Most of the time, we\'re taking things. Neither you nor I made the clothes we wear; we don\'t make the food or grow the foods we eat; we use a language that was developed by other people; we use another society\'s mathematics. Very rarely do we get a chance to put something back into that pool. I think we have that opportunity now.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“No, we don\'t know where it will lead. We just know there\'s something much bigger than any of us here.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We\'re trying to use the swiftness and creativity in a younger-style company, and yet bring to bear the tremendous resources of a company the size of Apple to do large projects that you could never handle at a startup.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“It\'s hard to tell with these Internet startups if they\'re really interested in building companies or if they\'re just interested in the money. I can tell you, though: If they don\'t really want to build a company, they won\'t luck into it. That\'s because it\'s so hard that if you don\'t have a passion, you\'ll give up.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“The best ideas have to win.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“My model for business is The Beatles. They were four guys who kept each other\'s kind of negative tendencies in check. They balanced each other, and the total was greater than the sum of the parts. That\'s how I see business: great things in business are never done by one person, they\'re done by a team of people.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We have wonderful arguments. If you want to hire great people and have them stay working for you, you have to let them make a lot of decisions and you have to, you have to be run by ideas, not hierarchy. The best ideas have to win, otherwise, good people don\'t stay.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“When you work with somebody that close and you go through experiences like the ones we went through, there\'s a bond in life. Whatever hassles you have, there is a bond. And even though he may not be your best friend as time goes on, there\'s still something that transcends even friendship, in a way.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I contribute ideas, sure. Why would I be there if I didn\'t?”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We are gambling on our vision, and we would rather do that than make \'me-too\' products. For us, it\'s always the next dream.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“If you are working on something exciting that you really care about, you don\'t have to be pushed. The vision pulls you.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“When we create stuff, we do it because we listen to customers, get their inputs and also throw in what we\'d like to see, too. We cook up new products. You never really know if people will love them as much as you do.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“There\'s an old Wayne Gretzky quote that I love. I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been. And we\'ve always tried to do that at Apple. Since the very, very beginning.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“You\'ve got to start with the customer experience and work backward to the Technology. You can\'t start with the technology and then try to figure out how to sell it.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“As we have tried to come up with a strategy and a vision for Apple, it started with “What incredible benefits can we give to the customer? Where can we take the customer?”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Part 1. There needs to be someone who is the keeper and reiterator of the vision. […] A lot of times, when you have to walk a thousand miles and you take the first step, it looks like a long way, and it really helps if there\'s someone there saying, “Well we\'re one step closer. The goal definitely exists; it\'s not just a mirage out there”.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Part 2. So in a thousand and one little, and sometimes larger ways, the vision needs to be reiterated. I do that a lot.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“When I got back here in 1997, I was looking for more room, and I found an archive of old Macs and other stuff. I said, \'Get it away!\' and I shipped all that shit off to Stanford. If you look backward in this business, you\'ll be crushed. You have to look forward.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“It\'s not about pop culture, and it\'s not about fooling people, and it\'s not about convincing people that they want something they don\'t. We figure out what we want. And I think we\'re pretty good at having the right discipline to think through whether a lot of other people are going to want it, too. That\'s what we get paid to do.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Even a great brand needs investment and caring if it\'s going to retain its relevance and vitality and the Apple brand has clearly suffered from neglect in this area in the last few years, and we need to bring it back. The way to do that is not to talk about speed and fees, it\'s not to talk about bits and mega-hertz, it\'s not to talk about why we are better than Windows.\nWhat does Nike do in their advertising? They honor great athletes, and they honor great athletics. That\'s who they are, that\'s what they are about.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“More important than building a product, we are in the process of architecting a company that will hopefully be much more incredible, the total will be much more incredible than the sum of its parts.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water or do you want a chance to change the world?”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“My dream is that every person in the world will have their own Apple computer.

As every day passes, the work fifty people are doing here is going to send a giant ripple through the universe. I am really impressed with the quality of our ripple. I know I might be a little hard to get on with, but this is the most fun I\'ve had in my life. I\'m having a blast.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We attract a different kind of person - a person who doesn\'t want to wait five or ten years to have someone take a giant risk on him or her. Someone who really wants to get a little over his head and make a little dent in the universe.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“My job is to say when something sucks rather than sugarcoat it.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“What I\'m best at doing is finding a group of talented people and making things with them.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“What I do all day, is meet with teams of people, and work on ideas, and solve problems, to make new products, to make new marketing programs, whatever it is.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“The greatest people are self-managing - they don\'t need to be managed. Once they know what to do, they\'ll go figure out how to do it. What they need is a common vision. And that\'s what leadership is: [h]aving a vision; being able to articulate that so the people around you can understand it; and getting a consensus on a common vision.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Somebody once told me, “Manage the top line, and the bottom line will follow.” What\'s the top line? It\'s things like, why are we doing this in the first place? What\'s our strategy? What are customers saying? How responsive are we? Do we have the best products and the best people? Those are the kind of questions you have to focus on.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We\'ve got 25,000 people at Apple. About 10,000 of them are in the stores. And my job is to work with sort of the top 100 people, that\'s what I do. That doesn\'t mean they\'re all vice presidents. Some of them are just key individual contributors.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“When a good idea comes, you know, part of my job is to move it around, just see what different people think, get people talking about it, argue with people about it, get ideas moving among that group of 100 people, get different people together to explore different aspects of it quietly, and, you know - just explore things.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Companies, as they grow to become multi-billion-dollar entities, somehow lose their vision. They insert lots of layers of middle management between the people running the company and the people doing the work. They no longer have an inherent feel or a passion about the products.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“The people who are doing the work are the moving force behind the Macintosh. My job is to create a space for them, to clear out the rest of the organization and keep it at bay.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“My job is not to be easy on people. My job is to make them better.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“My job is to pull things together from different parts of the company and clear the ways and get the resources for the key projects. And to take these great people we have and to push them and make them even better, coming up with more aggressive visions of how it could be.\nIt doesn\'t make sense to hire smart people and tell them what to do; we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I want to see what people are like under pressure.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“If they fall in love with Apple, everything else will take care of itself. They\'ll want to do what\'s best for Apple, not what\'s best for them, what\'s best for Steve, or anybody else.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We hire people who want to make the best things in the world. You\'d be surprised how hard people work over around here. They work nights and weekends, sometimes not seeing their families for a while. Sometimes people work through Christmas to make sure the tooling is just right at some factory in some corner of the world so our product comes out the best it can be. People care so much, and it shows.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“They have to be really smart. But the real issue for me is, are they going to fall in love with Apple?”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“All we are is our ideas or people. That\'s what keeps us going to work in the morning, to hang around these great bright people. I\'ve always thought that recruiting is the heart and soul of what we do.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“The secret of my success is that we have gone to exceptional lengths to hire the best people in the world. And when you\'re in a field where the dynamic range is 25 to 1, boy, does it pay off.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Recruiting is hard. It\'s just finding the needles in the haystack.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We do it ourselves and we spend a lot of time at it. I\'ve participated in the hiring of maybe 5,000+ people in my life. So I take it very seriously.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“You can\'t know enough in a one-hour interview. So, in the end, it\'s ultimately based on your gut. How do I feel about this person? What are they like when they\'re challenged? Why are they here? I ask everybody that: \'Why are you here?\' The answers themselves are not what you\'re looking for. It\'s the meta-data.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“My number one job here at Apple is to make sure that the top 100 people are A+ players. And everything else will take care of itself.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Many times in an interview I will purposely upset someone: I\'ll criticize their prior work. I\'ll do my homework, find out what they worked on, and say, “God, that really turned out to be a bomb. That really turned out to be a bozo product. Why did you work on that?…”.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I want to see if they just fold or if they have firm conviction, belief, and pride in what they did.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Well, they\'re just yardsticks, you know.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“You should never start a company with the goal of getting rich. Your goal should be making something you believe in and making a company that will last.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I think money is a wonderful thing because it enables you to do things, it enables you to invest in ideas that don\'t have a short-term payback and things like that.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“It\'s very interesting, I was worth about over a million dollars when I was 23 and over 10 million when I was 24 and over a hundred million when I was 25 and it wasn\'t that important because I never did it for the money.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“But especially at that point in my life it was not the most important thing, the most important thing was the company, the people, the products we were making, what we were going to enable people to do with these products so I didn\'t think about it a great deal, and I never sold any stock, just really believe that the company would do very well over the long term.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Bottom line is, I didn\'t return to Apple to make a fortune. I\'ve been very lucky in my life and already have one.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“When I was 25, my net worth was $100 million or so. I decided then that I wasn\'t going to let it ruin my life. There\'s no way you could ever spend it all, and I don\'t view wealth as something that validates my intelligence.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I\'m not going to let it ruin my life. Isn\'t it kind of funny? You know, my main reaction to this money thing is that it\'s humorous, all the attention to it, because it\'s hardly the most insightful or valuable thing that\'s happened to me in the past ten years.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“It makes me feel old, sometimes, when I speak at a campus and I find that what students are most in awe of is the fact that I\'m a millionaire.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Well, they\'re just yardsticks, you know. The neatest thing was, by 1979, I was able to walk into classrooms that had 15 Apple computers and see the kids using them. And those are the kinds of things that are really the milestones.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“None of those people care about the money. I mean, a lot of them made a lot of money, but they don\'t really care. Their lifestyles haven\'t particularly changed. It was the chance to actually try something, to fail, to succeed, to grow.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“To me, marketing is about values.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“It\'s a very complicated world. It\'s a very noisy world. And we not gonna get a chance to get people to remember much about us. No company is. So we have to be really clear on what we want them to know about us.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We don\'t stand a chance of advertising with features and benefits and with RAMs and with charts and comparisons. The only chance we have of communicating is with a feeling.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“You can\'t just ask customers what they want and then try to give that to them. By the time you get it built, they\'ll want something new.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We have no idea how far it\'s going to go.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Humans are tool builders. We create things to amplify ourselves. The computer will rank at the top - it\'s the most awesome tool ever.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“What a computer is to me is the most remarkable tool that we have ever come up with. It\'s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We think basically you watch television to turn your brain off, and you work on your computer when you want to turn your brain on.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I think everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer, should learn a computer language because it teaches you how to think.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Talking about bicycles: Human are tool builders, and we build tools that can dramatically amplify our innate human abilities. We actually ran an ad like this early at Apple that the personal computer is the bicycle of the mind and I believe that with every bone in my body that all the inventions of humans, the computer is going to rank near, if not at the top, as history unfolds and we look back.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“It is the most awesome tool that we ever invented (the computer). And I feel incredibly lucky to be at exactly the right place in Silicon Valley, at exactly the right time historically where this invention has taken form.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“A computer is the most incredible tool we\'ve ever seen. It can be a writing tool, a communications center, a super calculator, a planner, a filer and an artistic instrument all in one, just by being given new instructions, or software, to work from. There are no other tools that have the power and versatility of a computer.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Right now, computers make our lives easier. They do work for us in fractions of a second that would take us hours. They increase the quality of life, some of that by simply automating drudgery and some of that by broadening our possibilities. As things progress, they\'ll be doing more and more for us.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“These technologies can make life easier, can let us touch people we might not otherwise. You may have a child with a birth defect and be able to get in touch with other parents and support groups, get medical information, the latest experimental drugs. These things can profoundly influence life. I\'m not downplaying that.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I think it\'s brought the world a lot closer together, and will continue to do that. There are downsides to everything; there are unintended consequences to everything. The most corrosive piece of technology that I\'ve ever seen is called television - but then, again, television, at its best, is magnificent.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“On how will the Web impact our society: We live in an information economy, but I don\'t believe we live in an information society. People are thinking less than they used to. It\'s primarily because of television. People are reading less and they\'re certainly thinking less.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I don\'t see most people using the Web to get more information. We\'re already in information overload. No matter how much information the Web can dish out, most people get far more information than they can assimilate anyway.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“But the next thing is going to be computer as guide or agent. And what that means is that it\'s going to do more in terms of anticipating what we want and doing it for us, noticing connections and patterns in what we do, asking us if this is some sort of generic thing we\'d like to do regularly, so that we\'re going to have, as an example, the concept of triggers.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We\'re going to be able to ask our computers to monitor things for us, and when certain conditions happen, are triggered, the computers will take certain actions and inform us after the fact.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“The point is that tools are always going to be used for certain things we don\'t find personally pleasing. And it\'s ultimately the wisdom of people, not the tools themselves, that is going to determine whether or not these things are used in positive, productive ways.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I do feel there is another way we have an effect on society besides our computers.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“One of the things that made Apple great was that, in the early days, it was built from the heart.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“And boy, have we patented it. (First announcement of the iPhone, Macworld 2006)”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“The roots of Apple were to build computers for people, not for corporations. The world doesn\'t need another Dell or Compaq.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“You know, everybody has a cell phone, but I don\'t know one person who likes their cell phone. I want to make a phone that people love.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“What if Apple didn\'t exist? Think about it. Time wouldn\'t get published next week. Some 70% of the newspaper in the U.S. wouldn\'t publish tomorrow morning. Some 60% of the kids wouldn\'t have computers; 64% of the teachers wouldn\'t have computers. More than half the Websites created on Macs wouldn\'t exist. So there\'s something worth saving here. See?”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“What are the great brands? Levi\'s, Coke, Disney, Nike. Most people would put Apple in that category. You could spend billions of dollars building a brand not as good as Apple. Yet Apple hasn\'t been doing anything with this incredible asset.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“What is Apple, after all? Apple is about people who think \'outside the box\", people who want to use computers to help them change the world, to help them create things that make a difference, and not just to get a job done.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Apple\'s the only company left in this industry that designs the whole widget. Hardware, software, developer relations, marketing.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything. It\'s very fortunate if you can work on just one of these in your career. Apple\'s been very fortunate in that it\'s introduced a few of these.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“What we want to do is make a leapfrog product that is way smarter than any mobile device has ever been, and super-easy to use. This is what iPhone is. OK? So, we\'re going to reinvent the phone.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I had this idea of being able to get rid of the keyboard, type on a multi-touch glass display, and I asked our folks, “Could we come up with a multi-touch display?”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We designed iMac to deliver the things consumers care about most: the excitement of the Internet and the simplicity of the Mac.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“It\'s not about charisma and personality, it\'s about results and products and those very bedrock things that are why people at Apple and outside of Apple are getting more excited about the company and what Apple stands for and what its potential is to contribute to the industry.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Talking about the iPod Nano: We\'re in uncharted territory. We\'ve never sold this many of anything before.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I\'ve always been attracted to the more revolutionary changes.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“It\'s very easy to take credit for the thinking. The doing is more concrete. But somebody, it\'s very easy to say “Oh, I thought of these three years ago”. But usually when you dig a little deeper, you find that the people that really did it were also the people that really worked through the hard intellectual problems as well.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Innovation has nothing to do with how many R&D dollars you have. When Apple came up with the Mac, IBM was spending at least 100 times more on R&D. It\'s not about money. It\'s about the people you have, how you\'re led, and how much you get it.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I discovered that the best innovation is sometimes the company, the way you organize a company. The whole notion of how you build a company is fascinating.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Leonardo [da Vinci] was the artist but he also mixed all his own paints. He also was a fairly good chemist. He knew about pigments, knew about human anatomy. And combining all of those skills together, the art and the science, the thinking and the doing, was what resulted in the exceptional result.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“When companies get bigger they try to replicate their success. But they assume their magic came from process.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Actually, making an insanely great product has a lot to do with the process of making the product, how you learn things and adopt new ideas and throw out old ideas.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“People get stuck as they get older. Our minds are sort of electrochemical computers. Your thoughts construct patterns like scaffolding in your mind. You are really etching chemical patterns. In most cases, people get stuck in those patterns, just like grooves in a record, and they never get out of them. It\'s a rare person who etches grooves that are other than a specific way of looking at things, a specific way of questioning things.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“You always have to keep pushing to innovate. Dylan could have sung protest songs forever and probably made a lot of money, but he didn\'t. He had to move on, and when he did, by going electric in 1965, he alienated a lot of people. His 1966 Europe tour was his greatest.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“The Beatles were the same way. They kept evolving, moving, refining their art. That\'s what I\'ve always tried to do - keep moving. Otherwise, as Dylan says, if you are not busy being born, you\'re busy dying.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower. (Related: Five Ways to Innovate Faster, hbr.org)”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I don\'t think that my role in life is to run big organizations and do incremental improvements.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I have a great respect for incremental improvement, and I\'ve done that sort of thing in my life, but I\'ve always been attracted to the more revolutionary changes. I don\'t know why. Because they\'re harder. They\'re much more stressful emotionally. And you usually go through a period where everybody tells you that you\'ve completely failed.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“The people who go to see our movies are trusting us with something very important - their time and their imagination. So in order to respect that trust, we have to keep changing; we have to challenge ourselves and try to surprise our audiences with something new every time.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Innovation comes from people meeting up in the hallways or calling each other at 10:30 at night with a new idea, or because they realized something that shoots holes in how we\'ve been thinking about a problem.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“It\'s ad hoc meetings of six people called by someone who thinks he has figured out the coolest new thing ever and who wants to know what other people think of his idea.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“You can\'t go out and ask people, you know, what the next big thing is. There\'s a great quote by Henry Ford, right? He said, \'If I\'d have asked my customers what they wanted, they would have told me \'A faster horse\'.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Sometimes when you innovate, you make mistakes. It is best to admit them quickly and get on with improving your other innovations.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“The theme of the campaign is \'Think different\'. It\'s honoring the people who think different, and who move this world forward.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Apple is built on refugees from other companies. These are the extremely bright individual contributors who were troublemakers at other companies.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“The people who made Mac are sort of on the edge.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“On if he is a nerd or a hippie: If I had to pick one of those two I\'m clearly a hippie. All the people that I worked with were clearly in that category too.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I think the artistry is in having an insight into what one sees around them. Generally putting things together in a way no one else has before and finding a way to express that to other people who don\'t have that insight.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Creativity is just connecting things.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I don\'t think that most of the really best people that I\'ve worked with worked with computers for the sake of working with computers. They worked with computers because they are the medium that is best capable of transmitting some feeling that you have, that you want to share with other people.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“What I do see is a small group of people who are artists and care more about their art than they do about almost anything else. It\'s more important than finding a girlfriend, it\'s more important… than cooking a meal, it\'s more important than joining the Marines, it\'s more important than whatever.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Look at the way artists work. They\'re not typically the most \'balanced\' people in the world. Now, yes, we have a few workaholics here who are trying to escape other things, of course. But the majority of people out here have made very conscious decisions; they really have.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“It\'s rare that you see an artist in his 30s or 40s able to really contribute something amazing. Of course, there are some people who are innately curious, forever little kids in their awe of life, but they\'re rare.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“You\'ve baked a really lovely cake, but then you\'ve used dog shit for frosting.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“The broader one\'s understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Design is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I want it to be as beautiful as possible, even if it\'s inside the box. A great carpenter isn\'t going to use lousy wood for the back of a cabinet, even though nobody\'s going to see it.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“To design something really well, you have to get it. You have to really grok what it\'s all about. It takes a passionate commitment to really thoroughly understand something, chew it up, not just quickly swallow it. Most people don\'t take the time to do that.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Many companies forget what it means to make great products. After initial success, sales and marketing people take over and the product people eventually make their way out.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“When you\'re a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you\'re not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall and nobody will ever see it. You\'ll know it\'s there, so you\'re going to use a beautiful piece of wood on the back.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I love it when you can bring really great design and simple capability to something that doesn\'t cost much. It was the original vision for Apple. That\'s what we tried to do with the first Mac. That\'s what we did with the iPod.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“It takes a lot of hard work to make something simple, to truly understand the underlying challenges and come up with elegant solutions.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“A lot of people in our industry haven\'t had very diverse experiences. So they don\'t have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We will make them bright and pure and honest about being high-tech, rather than a heavy industrial look of black, black, black, black, like Sony.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We spent some time in our family talking about what\'s the trade-off we want to make. We ended up talking a lot about design, but also about the values of our family. Did we care most about getting our wash done in an hour versus an hour and a half? Or did we care most about our clothes feeling really soft and lasting longer? Did we care about using a quarter of the water?”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We spent two weeks talking about this every night at the dinner table. We\'d get around to that old washer-dryer discussion. And the talk was about design.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“People think it\'s this veneer - that the designers are handed this box and told, \'Make it look good!\' That\'s not what we think design is. It\'s not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“You\'re asking, where does aesthetic judgment come from? With many things: high-performance automobiles, for example, the aesthetic comes right from the function, and I suppose electronics is no different.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I\'ve also found that the best companies pay attention to aesthetics. They take the extra time to lay out grids and proportion things appropriately, and it seems to pay off for them. I mean, beyond the functional benefits, the aesthetic communicates something about how they think of themselves, their sense of discipline in engineering, how they run their company, stuff like that.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“It\'s really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don\'t know what they want until you show it to them.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Designing a product is keeping five thousand things in your brain, these concepts and fitting them all together in kind of continuing to push to fit them together in new and different ways to get what you want.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Every day you discover something new that is a new problem or a new opportunity to fit these things together a little differently.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I have always found Buddhism - Japanese Zen Buddhism in particular - to be aesthetically sublime. The most sublime thing I\'ve ever seen are the gardens around Kyoto.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Look at the Mercedes design, the proportion of sharp detail to flowing lines. Over the years, they have made the design softer but the details starker. That\'s what we have to do with the Macintosh.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“You\'ve got to start with the customer experience and work backward to the technology.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“What we\'re trying to do is remove the barrier of having to learn how to use a computer.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“This is what customers pay us for - to sweat all these details so it\'s easy and pleasant for them to use our computers. We\'re supposed to be really good at this. That doesn\'t mean we don\'t listen to customers.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“It\'s hard for them to tell you what they want when they\'ve never seen anything remotely like it. Take desktop video editing. I never got one request from someone who wanted to edit movies on his computer. Yet now that people see it, they say, \'Oh my God, that\'s great!\'.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“What we\'re going to do is make the products high-tech, and we\'re going to package them cleanly so that you know they\'re high-tech. We will fit them in a small package, and then we can make them beautiful and white, just like Braun does with its electronics.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“On making simple designs: It\'s insane: We all have busy lives, we have jobs, we have interests, and some of us have children. Everyone\'s lives are just getting busier, not less busy, in this busy society. You just don\'t have time to learn this stuff, and everything\'s getting more complicated… We both don\'t have a lot of time to learn how to use a washing machine or a phone.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Our DNA is as a consumer company - for that individual customer who\'s voting thumbs up or thumbs down. That\'s who we think about.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We think that our job is to take responsibility for the complete user experience.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We want to stand at the intersection of computers and humanism.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Besides Dylan, I was interested in Eastern mysticism, which hit the shores at about the same time.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Woz and I very much liked Bob Dylan\'s poetry, and we spent a lot of time thinking about a lot of that stuff.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I started to listen to music a whole lot and I started to read more outside of just science and technology, Shakespeare, Plato. I loved \'King Lear\'.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Apple is about something more than that, Apple, at the core, its core value, is that we believe that people with passion can change the world for the better.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Learning to program teaches you how to think. Computer science is a liberal art.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Picasso had a saying: good artists copy, great artists steal. And we have always been shameless about stealing great ideas, and I think part of what made the Macintosh great was that the people working on it were musicians and poets and artists and zoologists and historians who also happened to be the best computer scientists in the world.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“On why he made everybody sign the Mac cases: Because the people that worked on it consider themselves and I certainly consider them artists. These are the people that under different circumstances would be painters and poets but because of that time that we live in this new medium has appeared in which to express oneself to one\'s fellow species and that\'s a medium of computing.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“How do you know the direction to head with products? It boils down to taste. Emerge yourself with the best ideas from the humanities. And integrate them.

Some are better than others, but they all consider that an important part of their life. I don\'t believe that the best people in any of these fields see themselves as one branch of a forked tree. I just don\'t see that. People bring these things together a lot.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Anyway, one of our biggest challenges, and the one I think John Sculley and I should be judged on in five to ten years, is making Apple an incredibly great 10 or 20 billion-dollar company. \'Will it still have the spirit it does today?\' We\'re charting new territory.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“If Apple becomes a place where computers are a commodity item, where the romance is done, and where people forget that computers are the most incredible invention that man has ever invented, I\'ll feel I have lost Apple. But if I\'m a million miles away, and all those people still feel those things… then I will feel that my genes are still there.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“You know, Dr. Edwin Land was a troublemaker. He dropped out of Harvard and founded Polaroid.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“On Dr. Edwin Land: Not only was he one of the great inventors of our time but, more important, he saw the intersection of art and science and business and built an organization to reflect that.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“You need a very product-oriented culture, even in a technology company. Lots of companies have tons of great engineers and smart people. But ultimately, there needs to be some gravitational force that pulls it all together. Otherwise, you can get great pieces of technology all floating around the universe. But it doesn\'t add up to much.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We did iTunes because we all love music. We made what we thought was the best jukebox in iTunes. Then we all wanted to carry our whole music libraries around with us. The team worked really hard. And the reason that they worked so hard is because we all wanted one. You know? I mean, the first few hundred customers were us.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“What are we, anyway? Most of what we think we are is just a collection of likes and dislikes, habits, patterns. At the core of what we are is our values, and what decisions and actions we make reflect those values.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Well, I was thrown out of school a few times.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Invest time in yourself to have great experiences that are going to enrich you.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I didn\'t see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“The key thing to remember about me is that I\'m still a student. I\'m still in boot camp. If anyone is reading any of my thoughts, I\'d keep that in mind.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I think if you do something and it turns out pretty good, then you should go do something else wonderful, not dwell on it for too long. Just figure out what\'s next.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country… I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can\'t capture, and I found it fascinating. None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We wanted to more richly experience why were we were alive, not just make a better life, and so people went in search of things. The great thing that came from that time was to realize that there was definitely more to life than the materialism of the late 50\'s and early sixties. We were going in search of something deeper.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Between my sophomore and junior years, I got stoned for the first time; I discovered Shakespeare, Dylan Thomas, and all that classic stuff. I read Moby Dick and went back as a junior taking creative-writing classes.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“You could get LSD fresh made from Stanford. You could sleep on the beach at night with your girlfriend. California has a sense of experimentation and a sense of openness - openness to new possibilities.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Human minds settle into fixed ways of looking at the world and that\'s always been true and it\'s probably always going to be true.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“There\'s a phrase in Buddhism, \'Beginner\'s mind\'. It\'s wonderful to have a beginner\'s mind.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I\'m completely stunned. I\'m 19 years old, in a foreign country, up in the Himalayas, and here is this bizarre Indian baba who has just dragged me away from the rest of the crowd, shaving my head atop this mountain peak. I\'m still not sure why he did it.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I bought an apartment in New York, but it\'s because I love that city. I\'m trying to educate myself, being from a small town in California, not having grown up with the sophistication and culture of a large city. I consider it part of my education.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I used to think that technology could help education. I\'ve probably spearheaded giving away more computer equipment to schools than anybody else on the planet. But I\'ve had to come to the inevitable conclusion that the problem is not one that technology can hope to solve. What\'s wrong with education cannot be fixed with technology. No amount of technology will make a dent.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“The most important thing is a person. A person who incites and feeds your curiosity; and machines cannot do that in the same way that people can.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“One of the saints in my life is this woman named Imogene Hill, who was a fourth-grade teacher who taught this advanced class. She got hip to my whole situation in about a month and kindled a passion in me for learning things. I learned more that year than I think I learned in any year in school.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I was pretty bored in school, and I turned into a little terror. You should have seen us in third grade. We basically destroyed our teacher. We would let snakes loose in the classroom and explode bombs.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“School was pretty hard for me at the beginning.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“My mother taught me how to read before I got to school and so when I got there I really just wanted to do two things. I wanted to read books because I loved reading books and I wanted to go outside and chase butterflies. You know, do the things that five-year-olds like to do. I encountered authority of a different kind than I had ever encountered before, and I did not like it. And they really almost got me. They came close to really beating any curiosity out of me.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Obviously, one of the great challenges of an education is to teach us how to think. What we\'re finding is that computers are actually going to affect the quality of thinking as more and more of our children have these tools available to them.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I know from my own education that if I hadn\'t encountered two or three individuals that spent extra time with me, I\'m sure I would have been in jail.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“When you\'re young, a little bit of course correction goes a long way. I think it takes pretty talented people to do that.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“If you just sit and observe, you will see how restless your mind is. If you try to calm it, it only makes it worse, but over time it does calm, and when it does, there\'s room to hear more subtle things - that\'s when your intuition starts to blossom and you start to see things more clearly and be in the present more. Your mind just slows down, and you see a tremendous expanse in the moment. You see so much more than you could see before.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Focusing is about saying no.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Just get rid of the crappy stuff and focus on the good stuff.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We try to focus and do very few things well. And focusing is hard because focusing doesn\'t mean saying yes, it means saying no. So we decide not to do a lot of things so we can focus on a handful of things and do them well.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it\'s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I have a very simple life. I have my family and I have Apple and Pixar. And I don\'t do much else.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“My favorite things in life don\'t cost any money.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Well, my favorite things in life are books, sushi and… My favorite things in life don\'t cost any money. It\'s really clear that the most precious resource we all have is time. As it is, I pay a price by not having much of a personal life. I don\'t have the time to pursue love affairs or to tour small towns in Italy and sit in cafés and eat tomato-and-mozzarella salad.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I end up not buying a lot of things, because I find them ridiculous.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“The way we\'re running the company, the product design, the advertising, it all comes down to this: Let\'s make it simple. Really simple.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Look at the design of a lot of consumer products - they\'re really complicated surfaces. We tried to make something much more holistic and simple.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“When you first start off trying to solve a problem, the first solutions you come up with are very complex, and most people stop there. But if you keep going, and live with the problem and peel more layers of the onion off, you can oftentimes arrive at some very elegant and simple solutions. Most people just don\'t put in the time or energy to get there.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We believe that customers are smart and want objects which are well thought through.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“What I found when I got here was a zillion and one products. It was amazing. And I started to ask people, now why would I recommend a 3400 over a 4400? When should somebody jump up to a 6500, but not a 7300? And after three weeks, I couldn\'t figure this out. If I couldn\'t figure this out… how could our customers figure this out?”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Apple is a $30 billion company, yet we\'ve got less than 30 major products. I don\'t know if that\'s ever been done before. Certainly the great consumer electronics companies of the past had thousands of products. We tend to focus much more. People think focus means saying yes to the thing you\'ve got to focus on. But that\'s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We\'re always thinking about new markets we could enter, but it\'s only by saying no that you can concentrate on the things that are really important.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Quality is more important than quantity. One home run is much better than two doubles.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We had a fundamental belief that doing it right the first time was going to be easier than having to go back and fix it. And I cannot say strongly enough that the repercussions of that attitude are staggering. I\'ve seen them again and again throughout my business life.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We\'re not going to be the first to this party, but we\'re going to be the best.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“There\'s some stuff in our industry that we wouldn\'t be proud to ship.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“If they are working in an environment where excellence is expected, then they will do excellent work without anything but self-motivation. I\'m talking about an environment in which excellence is noticed and respected and is in the culture. If you have that, you don\'t have to tell people to do excellent work. They understand it from their surroundings.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I have to tell you there\'s some stuff in our industry that we wouldn\'t be proud to ship, that we wouldn\'t be proud to recommend to our family and friends. And we can\'t do it, we just can\'t ship junk.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We think the Mac will sell zillions, but we didn\'t build the Mac for anybody else. We built it for ourselves.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“We were the group of people who were going to judge whether it was great or not. We weren\'t going to go out and do market research. We just wanted to build the best thing we could build.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“The only problem with Microsoft is they just have no taste.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“They have absolutely no taste. And I don\'t mean that in a small way, I mean that in a big way, in the sense that they don\'t think of original ideas, and they don\'t bring much culture into their products.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“The older I get, the more I see how much motivations matter. The Zune was crappy because the people at Microsoft don\'t really love music or art the way we do. We won because we personally love music.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I am saddened, not by Microsoft success, I have no problem with their success, they\'ve earned their success, for the most part. I have a problem with the fact that they just make really third-rate products.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Their products have no spirit of enlightenment about them, they are very pedestrian. The sad part is that customers don\'t have a lot of that spirit either, but the way that we\'re going to ratchet up our species is to take the best and to spread it around everybody so that everybody grows up with better things and starts to understand the subtlety of these better things.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“I wish him the best, I really do. I just think he and Microsoft are a bit narrow. He\'d be a broader guy if he had dropped acid once or gone off to an ashram when he was younger.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Their products have no spirit to them.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Microsoft has had two goals in the last 10 years. One was to copy the Mac, and the other was to copy Lotus\' success in the spreadsheet - basically, the applications business. And over the course of the last 10 years, Microsoft accomplished both of those goals. And now they are completely lost.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“With our technology, with objects, literally three people in a garage can blow away what 200 people at Microsoft can do.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Our friends up north spend over five billion dollars on research and development and all they seem to do is copy Google and Apple.”\n\n- Steve Jobs", "“Steve Job\'s final words\n“OH WOW. OH WOW. OH WOW.”\n(When he was on the bed for the last moment, he looked at his sister Patty, his children, then at his life\'s partner, Laurene. According to his thoughts on life, he was happy that all his loved ones were with him. The only thing or memories a person can take with him or her while leaving this materialistic world is beautiful relations and memories made with them.”\n\n- Steve Jobs"};

While we have this body, and especially this amazing human brain, I think every minute is something precious.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“There are two kinds of compassion. The first comes from a natural concern for friends and family who are close to us. This has limited range but can be the seed for something bigger. We can also learn to extend a genuine concern for others' well-being, whoever they are. That is real compassion, and only human beings are capable of developing it.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“Given the scale of life in the cosmos, one human life is no more than a tiny blip. Each one of us is a just visitor to this planet, a guest, who will only stay for a limited time. What greater folly could there be than to spend this short time alone, unhappy or in conflict with our companions? Far better, surely, to use our short time here in living a meaningful life, enriched by our sense of connection with others and being of service to them.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“Sometimes one creates a dynamic impression by saying something, and sometimes one creates as significant an impression by remaining silent.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“Open your arms to change but don't let go of your values.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“When life becomes too complicated and we feel overwhelmed, it's often useful just to stand back and remind ourselves of our overall purpose, our overall goal. When faced with a feeling of stagnation and confusion, it may be helpful to take an hour, an afternoon, or even several days to simply reflect on what it is that will truly bring us happiness, and then reset our priorities on the basis of that. This can put our life back in proper context, allow a fresh perspective, and enable us to see which direction to take.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“It is under the greatest adversity that there exists the greatest potential for doing good, both for oneself and others.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“Hard times build determination and inner strength. Through them we can also come to appreciate the uselessness of anger. Instead of getting angry nurture a deep caring and respect for troublemakers because by creating such trying circumstances they provide us with invaluable opportunities to practice tolerance and patience.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“In order to become prosperous, a person must initially work very hard, so he or she has to sacrifice a lot of leisure time.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“The quality of what we do depends on our motivation, which is why we have to learn how to cultivate a compassionate mind.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“Be compassionate, not just to your friends but to everyone.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“Optimism doesn't mean that you are blind to the reality of the situation. It means that you remain motivated to seek a solution to whatever problems arise.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“As long as we observe love for others and respect for their rights and dignity in our daily lives, then whether we are learned or unlearned, whether we believe in the Buddha or God, follow some religion or none at all, as long as we have compassion for others and conduct ourselves with restraint out of a sense of responsibility, there is no doubt we will be happy.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“We all have the power of thought - so what are you lacking? If you have willpower, then you can change anything.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“Take into account that great love and great achievements involve great risk.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“Remember that sometimes not getting what you want is a wonderful stroke of luck.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“Instead of looking to blame others and the world around us, we should first look within ourselves.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“In this century we have made remarkable material progress, but basically we are the same as we were thousands of years ago. Our spiritual needs are still very great.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“The challenge today is to convince people of the value of truth, honesty, compassion and a concern for others.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“Responsibility does not only lie with the leaders of our countries or with those who have been appointed or elected to do a particular job. It lies with each of us individually. The Nobel Lecture, December 11, 1989”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“I will not propose to you that my way is best. The decision is up to you. If you find some point which may be suitable to you, then you can carry out experiments for yourself. If you find that it is of no use, then you can discard it.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“Look at children. Of course they may quarrel, but generally speaking they do not harbor ill feelings as much or as long as adults do. Most adults have the advantage of education over children, but what is the use of an education if they show a big smile while hiding negative feelings deep inside? Children don't usually act in such a manner. If they feel angry with someone, they express it, and then it is finished. They can still play with that person the following day.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“Only the development of compassion and understanding for others can bring us the tranquility and happiness we all seek.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“In our struggle for freedom, truth is the only weapon we possess.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“There is a saying in Tibetan, 'Tragedy should be utilized as a source of strength'. No matter what sort of difficulties, how painful experience is, if we lose our hope, that's our real disaster.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“Time passes unhindered. When we make mistakes, we cannot turn the clock back and try again. All we can do is use the present well.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“Appearance is something absolute, but reality is not that way - everything is interdependent, not absolute. So that view is very helpful to maintain a peace of mind because the main destroyer of a peaceful mind is anger.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“Because motivation pervades all action, it is important that we have a positive motivation. Whatever we are involved in, whether it's politics, education, medicine, law, engineering, science, business or industry, the nature of our motivation determines the character of our work.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“We are the controller of the technology. If we become a slave of technology, then that's not good.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“Ethics are not a collection of commandments and prohibitions to abide by, but a natural inner offering that can bring happiness and satisfaction to ourselves and others.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“It is very rare or almost impossible that an event can be negative from all points of view.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“I don't dwell on being the Dalai Lama, I think of myself as just another human being. And when I meet someone else I greet them as a brother or sister, which brings me joy. Self-centredness, being obsessed with ourselves, just brings us trouble.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“When you don't have much concern for others and you feel you're the center of the universe, you'll be dogged by feelings of suspicion left and right.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“We are deluded by attachment and anger, but we can learn to tackle these emotions.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“Develop the heart. Too much energy in your country is spent developing the mind instead of the heart.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“Thinking of ourselves as somehow special isolates us.”\n\n- Dalai Lama", "“Someone else's action should not determine your response.”\n\n- Dalai Lama"};

Never forget that God is able to lift you from the fatigue of despair to the buoyancy of hope, and transform dark and desolate valleys into sunlit paths of inner peace.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“My faith in man is, at bottom, a faith in God.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Love is the only force capable of transforming an enemy into friend.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“There can be no deep disappointment where there is not deep love.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Everybody can be great… because anybody can serve.

Hatred confuses life; love harmonizes it. Hatred darkens life; love illuminates it.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“I am convinced that love is the most durable power in the world. It is not an expression of impractical idealism, but of practical realism.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Far from being the pious injunction of a Utopian dreamer, love is an absolute necessity for the survival of our civilization. To return hate for hate does nothing but intensify the existence of evil in the universe.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Someone must have sense enough and religion enough to cut off the chain of hate and evil, and this can only be done through love.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Forgiveness does not mean ignoring what has been done or putting a false label on an evil act. It means, rather, that the evil act no longer remains as a barrier to the relationship. Forgiveness is a catalyst creating the atmosphere necessary for a fresh start and a new beginning.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“A genuine revolution of values means in the final analysis that our loyalties must become ecumenical rather than sectional. Every nation must now develop an overriding loyalty to mankind as a whole in order to preserve the best in their individual societies.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“We must develop and maintain the capacity to forgive. He who is devoid of the power to forgive is devoid of the power to love.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“There is some good in the worst of us and some evil in the best of us. When we discover this, we are less prone to hate our enemies.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality. This is why right, temporarily defeated, is stronger than evil triumphant.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Man must evolve for all human conflict a method which rejects revenge, aggression and retaliation. The foundation of such a method is love.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“We have before us the glorious opportunity to inject a new dimension of love into the veins of our civilization.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Not everybody can be famous but everybody can be great, because greatness is determined by service.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Only in the darkness can you see the stars.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“I feel that the people of ill will have used time much more effectively than have the people of good will.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Darkness cannot be overcome with more darkness, only with light. Violence cannot be overcome with more violence, only with peace.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“I mourn the loss of thousands of precious lives, but I will not rejoice in the death of one, not even an enemy. Returning hate, adding deeper darkness to a night that is already void of stars.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“We may cry out desperately for time to pause in her passage, but time is deaf to every plea and rushes on. Over the bleached bones and jumbled residues of numerous civilizations are written the pathetic words: \'Too late\'.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Procrastination is still the thief of time. Life often leaves us standing bare, naked and dejected with a lost opportunity.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual doom.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Have we not come to such an impasse in the modern world that we must love our enemies - or else? The chain reaction of evil - hate begetting hate, wars producing more wars - must be broken, or else we shall be plunged into the dark abyss of annihilation.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“There is little hope for us until we become tough-minded enough to break loose from the shackles of prejudice, half-truths, and downright ignorance. The shape of the world today does not permit us the luxury of soft mindedness.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“A nation or civilization that continues to produce soft-minded men purchases its own spiritual death on the installment plan.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“He who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it. He who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Never succumb to the temptation of bitterness.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Never forget that everything Hitler did in Germany was legal.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“We stand in life at midnight; we are always at the threshold of a new dawn.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“A riot is the language of the unheard.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“War is a poor chisel to carve out tomorrow.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Stumbling and groping through the wilderness finally must be replaced by a planned, organized and orderly march.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“The past is prophetic in that it asserts loudly that wars are poor chisels for carving out peaceful tomorrows.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“If you succumb to the temptation of using violence in the struggle, unborn generations will be the recipients of a long and desolate night of bitterness, and your chief legacy to the future will be an endless reign of meaningless chaos.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Violence as a way of achieving racial justice is both impractical and immoral. It is impractical because it is a descending spiral ending in destruction for all. The old law of an eye for an eye leaves everybody blind. It is immoral because it seeks to humiliate the opponent rather than win his understanding; it seeks to annihilate rather than to convert.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Violence is immoral because it thrives on hatred rather than love. It destroys community and makes brotherhood impossible. It leaves society in monologue rather than dialogue.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Violence ends by defeating itself. It creates bitterness in the survivors and brutality in the destroyers.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Like an unchecked cancer, hate corrodes the personality and eats away its vital unity. Hate destroys a man\'s sense of values and his objectivity. It causes him to describe the beautiful as ugly and the ugly as beautiful, and to confuse the true with the false and the false with the true.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“The limitation of riots, moral questions aside, is that they cannot win and their participants know it. Hence, rioting is not revolutionary but reactionary because it invites defeat. It involves an emotional catharsis, but it must be followed by a sense of futility.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“The more there are riots, the more repressive action will take place, and the more we face the danger of a right-wing takeover and eventually a fascist society.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“One of the greatest casualties of the war in Vietnam is the Great Society… shot down on the battlefield of Vietnam.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“The ultimate weakness of violence is that it is a descending spiral, begetting the very thing it seeks to destroy. Instead of diminishing evil, it multiplies it.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Through violence you may murder the liar, but you cannot murder the lie, nor establish the truth. Through violence you murder the hater, but you do not murder hate. In fact, violence merely increases hate. Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“In spite of temporary victories, violence never brings permanent peace.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“At the center of non-violence stands the principle of love.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Peace is not merely a distant goal that we seek, but a means by which we arrive at that goal.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“We still have a choice today: nonviolent coexistence or violent coannihilation. This may well be mankind\'s last chance to choose between chaos and community.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“We who in engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“I refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“We must concentrate not merely on the negative expulsion of war but the positive affirmation of peace.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Those who love peace must learn to organize as effectively as those who love war.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“The choice is not between violence and nonviolence but between nonviolence and nonexistence.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Here is the true meaning and value of compassion and nonviolence, when it helps us to see the enemy\'s point of view, to hear his questions, to know his assessment of ourselves.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“For from his view we may indeed see the basic weaknesses of our own condition, and if we are mature, we may learn and grow and profit from the wisdom of the brothers who are called the opposition.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Nonviolence is a powerful and just weapon, which cuts without wounding and ennobles the man who wields it. It is a sword that heals.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Nonviolence is the answer to the crucial political and moral questions of our time; the need for mankind to overcome oppression and violence without resorting to oppression and violence.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Nonviolence means avoiding not only external physical violence but also internal violence of spirit. You not only refuse to shoot a man, but you refuse to hate him.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“We adopt the means of nonviolence because our end is a community at peace with itself. We will try to persuade with our words, but if our words fail, we will try to persuade with our acts.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“It is not enough to say we must not wage war. It is necessary to love peace and sacrifice for it.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“Peace is not simply the absence of conflict, but the existence of justice for all people.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“The silence of the good people is more dangerous than the brutally of the bad people.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“It\'s not the violence of the few that scares me, it\'s the silence of the many.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“The ultimate tragedy is not the oppression and cruelty by the bad people but the silence over that by the good people.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr", "“History will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clamor of the bad people, but the appalling silence of the good people.”\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr"};

But now, especially in these free States, nearly all are educated--quite too nearly all, to leave the labor of the uneducated, in any wise adequate to the support of the whole. It follows from this that henceforth educated people must labor. Otherwise, education itself would become a positive and intolerable evil. No country can sustain, in idleness, more than a small percentage of its numbers. The great majority must labor at something productive.”\n\n- Abraham Lincoln", "“On the question of liberty, as a principle, we are not what we have been.

And when we turn around to find the self which knows this moment, we find that it has vanished like the past.”\n\n- Alan Watts", "“Once the mind has seen through all fear and all hope, it finds peace within itself, in a state of awareness beyond thought”\n\n- Alan Watts", "“If happiness always depends on something expected in the future, we are chasing a will-o'-the-wisp that ever eludes our grasp, until the future, and ourselves, vanish into the abyss of death.”\n\n- Alan Watts", "“Parts exist only for purposes of figuring and describing, and as we figure the world out, we become confused if we do not remember this all the time.”\n\n- Alan Watts", "“The destination of life is this eternal moment.”\n\n- Alan Watts", "“People sometimes fail to live because they are always preparing to live.”\n\n- Alan Watts", "“Technology is destructive only in the hands of people who do not realize that they are one and the same process as the universe.”\n\n- Alan Watts", "“The art of living… is neither careless drifting on the one hand nor fearful clinging to the past on the other.

When you swim, you don't grab hold of the water because if you do, you will sink and drown.

A dead body can walk again. Your leprosy can be cured. The blind can see. Nonsense. It's not moral to lie to children.

On every side, there is conclusive evidence that the contrary is the case and that faith causes people to be more mean, more selfish, and perhaps above all, more stupid.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“Since it is obviously inconceivable that all religions can be right, the most reasonable conclusion is that they are all wrong.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“The gods that we've made are exactly the gods you'd expect to be made by a species that's about half a chromosome away from being chimpanzee.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“Why do humans exist? A major part of the answer: because Pikaia Gracilens survived the Burgess decimation.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“Here is my challenge. Name one ethical statement made, or one ethical action performed, by a believer that could not have been uttered or done by a nonbeliever. And here is my second challenge. Can any reader think of a wicked statement made, or an evil action performed, precisely because of religious faith? The second question is easy to answer, is it not? The first - I have been asking it for some time - awaits a convincing reply. By what right, then, do the faithful assume this irritating mantle of righteousness? They have as much to apologize for as to explain.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“I have no time to waste on this planet being told what to do by those who think that God has given them instructions.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“Faith is the surrender of the mind; it's the surrender of reason, it's the surrender of the only thing that makes us different from other mammals. It's our need to believe and to surrender our skepticism and our reason, our yearning to discard that and put all our trust or faith in someone or something, that is the sinister thing to me. Of all the supposed virtues, faith must be the most overrated.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“I am absolutely convinced that religion is the main source of hatred in this world.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“It is a horrible idea that there is somebody who owns us, who makes us, who supervises us - waking and sleeping - who knows our thoughts, who can convict us of thought crime, thought crime, just for what we think, who can judge us while we sleep for things that might occur to us in our dreams, who can create us sick, as apparently we are - and then order us, on pain of eternal torture to be well again. To demand this, to wish this to be true is to wish to live as an abject slave.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“My own view is that this planet is used as a penal colony, lunatic asylum and dumping ground by a superior civilization, to get rid of the undesirable and unfit. I can't prove it, but you can't disprove it either.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“Violent, irrational, intolerant, allied to racism and tribalism and bigotry, invested in ignorance and hostile to free inquiry, contemptuous of women and coercive toward children: organized religion ought to have a great deal on its conscience.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“Islamophobia: a word created by fascists, and used by cowards, to manipulate morons.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“Those of us who write and study history are accustomed to its approximations and ambiguities. This is why we do not take literally the tenth-hand reports of frightened and illiterate peasants who claim to have seen miracles or to have had encounters with messiahs and prophets and redeemers who were, like them, mere humans. And this is also why we will never submit to dictation from those who display a fanatical belief in certainty and revelation.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“Beware the irrational, however seductive. Shun the 'transcendent' and all who invite you to subordinate or annihilate yourself. Distrust compassion; prefer dignity for yourself and others. Don't be afraid to be thought arrogant or selfish. Picture all experts as if they were mammals. Never be a spectator of unfairness or stupidity. Seek out argument and disputation for their own sake; the grave will supply plenty of time for silence.

Religion says that we would not know right from wrong, we would not know an evil, wicked act from a decent human act without divine permission, without divine authority or without, even worse, either the fear of a divine punishment or the hope of a divine reward. It strips us of the right to make our own determination, as all humans always have, about what is and what is not a right human action.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“The only real radicalism in our time will come as it always has—from people who insist on thinking for themselves and who reject party-mindedness.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“Thanks to the telescope and the microscope, religion no longer offers an explanation for anything important.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“Mockery of religion is one of the most essential things… one of the beginnings of human emancipation is the ability to laugh at authority.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“People are frightened of death, and the central lie of all religion is that there's a cure for this and an exception we've made in your own case: an eternal life offered if you make the right propitiations and the right abjections. Well, I'm sorry. I think that it's the height of immorality to lie to people like that. That's why [religion] survives.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“I sympathize afresh with the mighty Voltaire who, when badgered on his deathbed and urged to renounce the devil, murmured that this was no time to be making enemies.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“Human decency is not derived from religion. It precedes it.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“Many religions now come before us with ingratiating smirks and outspread hands, like an unctuous merchant in a bazaar. They offer consolation and solidarity and uplift, competing as they do in a marketplace. But we have a right to remember how barbarically they behaved when they were strong and were making an offer that people could not refuse.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“In the ordinary moral universe, the good will do the best they can, the worst will do the worst they can, but if you want to make good people do wicked things, you'll need religion.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“One must state it plainly. Religion comes from the period of human pre-history where nobody - not even the mighty Democritus who concluded that all matter was made from atoms - had the smallest idea what was going on.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“The true essence of a dictatorship is in fact not its regularity but its unpredictability and caprice; those who live under it must never be able to relax, must never be quite sure if they have followed the rules correctly or not.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“Take the risk of thinking for yourself”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“Mockery of religion is one of the most essential things because to demystify supposedly 'holy text dictated by god' and show that they are man-made and what you have to show [is] their internal inconsistencies and absurdities. One of the beginnings of human emancipation is the ability to laugh at authority… it is an indispensable thing people can call it blasphemy if they like, but if they call it that they have to assume there is something to be blasphemed - some divine work, well I don't accept the premise.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“MT [Mother Teresa] was not a friend of the poor. She was a friend of poverty. She said that suffering was a gift from God. She spent her life opposing the only known cure for poverty, which is the empowerment of women and the emancipation of them from a livestock version of compulsory reproduction.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“How dismal it is to see present-day Americans yearning for the very orthodoxy that their country was founded to escape.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“High moral character is not a precondition for great moral accomplishments.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“Religion is man-made. Even the men who made it cannot agree on what their prophets or redeemers or gurus actually said or did.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“Shepherds don't look after sheep because they love them - although I do think some shepherds like their sheep too much. They look after their sheep so they can, first, fleece them and second, turn them into meat. That's much more like the priesthood as I know it.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“To terrify children with the image of hell, to consider women an inferior creation - is that good for the world?”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“I'm an atheist. I'm not neutral about religion, I'm hostile to it. I think it is a positively bad idea, not just a false one. And I mean not just organized religion, but religious belief itself.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“Islam makes very large claims for itself. In its art, there is a prejudice against representing the human form at all. The prohibition on picturing the prophet - who was only another male mammal - is apparently absolute. So is the prohibition on pork or alcohol or, in some Muslim societies, music or dancing. Very well then, let a good Muslim abstain rigorously from all these. But if he claims the right to make me abstain as well, he offers the clearest possible warning and proof of an aggressive intent.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“People who think with their epidermis or their genitalia or their clan are the problem to begin with. One does not banish this specter by invoking it. If I would not vote against someone on the grounds of 'race' or 'gender' alone, then by the exact same token, I would not cast a vote in his or her favor for the identical reason. Yet see how this obvious question makes fairly intelligent people say the most alarmingly stupid things.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“What is it you most dislike? Stupidity, especially in its nastiest forms of racism and superstition.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“Endless praise and adoration, limitless abnegation and abjection of self; a celestial North Korea.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“Those who are determined to be 'offended' will discover a provocation somewhere. We cannot possibly adjust enough to please the fanatics, and it is degrading to make the attempt.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“In some ways, I feel sorry for racists and for religious fanatics because they so much miss the point of being human and deserve a sort of pity. But then I harden my heart and decide to hate them all the more because of the misery they inflict and because of the contemptible excuses they advance for doing so.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“To be the father of growing daughters is to understand something of what Yeats evokes with his imperishable phrase 'terrible beauty.' Nothing can make one so happily exhilarated or so frightened: it's a solid lesson in the limitations of self to realize that your heart is running around inside someone else's body. It also makes me quite astonishingly calm at the thought of death: I know whom I would die to protect and I alsounderstand that nobody but a lugubrious serf can possibly wish for a father who never goes away.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“Of course we have free will because we have no choice but to have it.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“Ever since I discovered that my god-given male member was going to give me no peace, I decided to give it no rest in return.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“Here's someone who says there's no such thing, it's all intelligent design. How sure am I of my own views? Don't take refuge in the false security of consensus, and the feeling that whatever you think you're bound to be okay because you're in the safely moral majority.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“Here is the point about myself and my co-thinkers. Our belief is not a belief. Our principles are not a faith. We do not hold our convictions dogmatically. We believe with certainty that an ethical life can be lived without religion. And we know for a fact that the corollary holds true - that religion has caused innumerable people not just to conduct themselves no better than others, but to award themselves permission to behave in ways that would make a brothel-keeper or an ethnic cleanser raise an eyebrow.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“To 'choose' dogma and faith over doubt and experience is to throw out the ripening vintage and to reach greedily for the Kool-Aid.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“One of the most repellent spectacles at election times is the pretense of piety on the part of people running for office.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“Skepticism rather than credulity is the highest principle that the human intellect can use to ennoble our existence.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“In one way, traveling has narrowed my mind. What I have discovered is something very ordinary and unexciting, which is that humans are the same everywhere and that the degree of variation between members of our species is very slight. This is, of course, an encouraging finding; it helps arm you against news programs back home that show seething or abject masses of either fanatical or torpid people. In another way, it is a depressing finding; the sorts of things that make people quarrel and make them stupid are the same everywhere.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“We have no proof that Socrates ever existed. We only know from witnesses to his life that he did. Like Jesus, he never wrote anything down. It doesn't matter to me whether he did or not exist because we have his teachings, his method of thinking, and his extreme intellectual and moral courage.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“Who are your favorite heroines in real life? The women of Afghanistan, Iraq, and Iran who risk their lives and their beauty to defy the foulness of theocracy. Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Azar Nafisi as their ideal feminine model.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens","“We have lived in a world where the discoveries of physics and genetics are far more awe-inspiring, as well as infinitely more liberating, than the claims of any religion.”\n\n- Christopher Hitchens"};

This is why our society is frazzled; this misconception that we can consciously do more than one thing at a time effectively.”\n\n- Deepak Chopra","“People are doing the best that they can from their own level of consciousness.”\n\n- Deepak Chopra","“Our minds influence the key activity of the brain, which then influences everything; perception, cognition, thoughts and feelings, personal relationships; they're all a projection of you.”\n\n- Deepak Chopra","“Meeting a stranger can be totally fleeting and meaningless, for example, unless you enter the individual's world by finding out at least one thing that is meaningful to his or her life and exchange at least one genuine feeling. Tuning in to others is a circular flow: you send yourself out toward people; you receive them as they respond to you.”\n\n- Deepak Chopra","“Life gives you plenty of time to do whatever you want to do if you stay in the present moment.”\n\n- Deepak Chopra","“The worst curse to befall anyone is stagnation, a banal existence, the quiet desperation that comes out of a need for conformity.”\n\n- Deepak Chopra","“New Age values are conscious evolution, a non-sectarian society, a non-military culture, global sharing, healing the environment, sustainable economies, self-determination, social justice, economic empowerment of the poor, love, compassion in action, going beyond religious fundamentalism, going beyond nationalism-extreme nationalism, culture.”\n\n- Deepak Chopra","“There are receptors to these molecules in your immune system, in your gut, and in your heart. So when you say, 'I have a gut feeling' or 'my heart is sad' or 'I am bursting with joy,' you're not speaking metaphorically. You're speaking literally.”\n\n- Deepak Chopra","“What keeps life fascinating is the constant creativity of the soul.”\n\n- Deepak Chopra","“The less you open your heart to others, the more your heart suffers.”\n\n- Deepak Chopra","“Mathematics expresses values that reflect the cosmos, including orderliness, balance, harmony, logic, and abstract beauty.”\n\n- Deepak Chopra","“I was very afraid at the beginning, until Master told me that pain isn't the truth; it's what you have to get through in order to find the truth.”\n\n- Deepak Chopra","“You and I are essentially infinite choice-makers. In every moment of our existence, we are in that field of all possibilities where we have access to an infinity of choices.”\n\n- Deepak Chopra","“If we are creating ourselves all the time, then it is never too late to begin creating the bodies we want instead of the ones we mistakenly assume we are stuck with.”\n\n- Deepak Chopra","“The real key is to live in an environment where the mind feels free to choose the right thing instead of being compelled by habit and inertia to choose the wrong thing.”\n\n- Deepak Chopra","“The greatest hunger in life is not for food, money, success, status, security, sex, or even love from the opposite sex. Time and again people have achieved all these things and wound up still feeling dissatisfied- indeed, often more dissatisfied than when they began. The deepest hunger in life is a secret that is revealed only when a person is willing to unlock a hidden part of the self. In the ancient traditions of wisdom, this quest has been likened to diving for the most precious pearl in existence, a poetic way of saying that you have to swim far out beyond shallow waters, plunge deep into yourself, and search patiently until the pearl beyond price is found. The pearl is also called essence, the breath of God, the water of life… labels for what we, in our more prosaic scientific age, would simply call TRANSFORMATION.”\n\n- Deepak Chopra","“A child in India grows up with the idea that you have to make choices that will create a better future. In fact, your whole life is a continuum of choices, so the more conscious you are, the greater your life will be.”\n\n- Deepak Chopra","“The healthiest response to life is joy.”\n\n- Deepak Chopra","“Self-awareness is value-free. It isn't scary. It doesn't imply that you will subject yourself to needless pain.”\n\n- Deepak Chopra","“The purpose of life is the expansion of happiness.”\n\n- Deepak Chopra","“People need to know that they have all the tools within themselves. Self-awareness, which means awareness of their body, awareness of their mental space, awareness of their relationships - not only with each other but with life and the ecosystem.”\n\n- Deepak Chopra","“There are no accidents… there is only some purpose that we haven't yet understood.”\n\n- Deepak Chopra","“Although we take it for granted, sanitation is a physical measure that has probably done more to increase human lifespan than any kind of drug or surgery.”\n\n- Deepak Chopra","“You alone are the judge of your worth, and your goal is to discover infinite worth in yourself, no matter what anyone else thinks.”\n\n- Deepak Chopra","“Ultimately spiritual awareness unfolds when you're flexible, when you're spontaneous, when you're detached, when you're easy on yourself and easy on others.”\n\n- Deepak Chopra","“At any given time, the universe is giving you the best result possible.”\n\n- Deepak Chopra","“Mature workers are less impulsive, less reactive, more creative and more centered.”\n\n- Deepak Chopra","“Spirituality is meant to take us beyond our tribal identity into a domain of awareness that is more universal.”\n\n- Deepak Chopra","“The world sometimes feels like an insane asylum. You can decide whether you want to be an inmate or pick up your visitor's badge. You can be in the world but not engage in the melodrama of it; you can become a spiritual being having a human experience thoroughly and fully.”\n\n- Deepak Chopra","“Nothing is more important than reconnecting with your bliss. Nothing isas rich. Nothing is more real.”\n\n- Deepak Chopra","“For thousands of years, human beings have been obsessed with beauty, truth, love, honor, altruism, courage, social relationships, art, and God. They all go together as subjective experiences, and it's a straw man to set God up as the delusion. If he is, then so is truth itself or beauty itself.”\n\n- Deepak Chopra","“We must go beyond the constant clamor of ego, beyond the tools of logic and reason, to the still, calm place within us: the realm of the soul.”\n\n- Deepak Chopra","“There is no fixed physical reality, no single perception of the world, just numerous ways of interpreting world views as dictated by one's nervous system and the specific environment of our planetary existence.”\n\n- Deepak Chopra","“We have to really educate ourselves in a way about who we are, what our real identity is.”\n\n- Deepak Chopra","“Before a brain can register a thought, a mind must think it… every step of the way is mind over matter… We override our brains all the time.”\n\n- Deepak Chopra","“Globalism began as a vision of a world with free trade, shared prosperity, and open borders. These are good, even noble things to aim for.”\n\n- Deepak Chopra"};

        // EXPLANATION:-
//        Certainly! Let me explain the provided code in simple terms:
//
//        When the shareIcon is clicked, the code inside the onClick() method will be executed.
//
//        The code starts by creating a Bitmap object named bitmap with the same width and height as the cardView.
//
//                It creates a Canvas object named canvas using the bitmap. This allows drawing on the bitmap.
//
//        The cardView is then drawn onto the canvas, capturing its visual representation as a bitmap.
//
//        The code defines a String variable named imagePath to store the file path where the image will be saved.
//
//                The imagePath is obtained by using the getExternalFilesDir() method with the parameter Environment.DIRECTORY_PICTURES. This retrieves the directory specific to your app for storing files in the Pictures directory on the external storage.
//
//        The code then attempts to create a FileOutputStream named outputStream using the imagePath. This allows writing the image data to the file.
//
//                The bitmap is compressed in the PNG format with a quality of 100% and is written to the outputStream.
//
//                After writing the image data, the outputStream is flushed and closed to ensure proper handling of the file.
//
//        If any exception occurs during the file writing process, it will be caught, and the corresponding error message will be printed to the console.
//
//        In summary, this code captures the visual representation of the cardView as a bitmap, saves it as a PNG image file in the app's external storage directory specific to the Pictures directory, and handles any potential errors during the process.
